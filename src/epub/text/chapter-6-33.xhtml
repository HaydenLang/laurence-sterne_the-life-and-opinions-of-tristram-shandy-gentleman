<p><span class="firstword">I told</span> the Christian
reader——I say <i>Christian</i>——hoping he is
one——and if he is not, I am sorry for
it——and only beg he will consider the matter with himself,
and not lay the blame entirely upon this <span class="locked">book——</span></p>
<p>I told him, Sir——for in good truth, when a man is telling
<span class="pagenum">
<a id="page340" name="page340">340</a></span>
a story in the strange way I do mine, he is obliged continually to be
going backwards and forwards to keep all tight together in the reader’s
fancy——which, for my own part, if I did not take heed to do
more than at first, there is so much unfixed and equivocal matter
starting up, with so many breaks and gaps in it,—and so little
service do the stars afford, which, nevertheless, I hang up in some
of the darkest passages, knowing that the world is apt to lose its way,
with all the lights the sun itself at noon-day can give
it——and now you see, I am lost <span class="locked">myself!———</span></p>
<p>——But ’tis my father’s fault; and whenever my brains come
to be dissected, you will perceive, without spectacles, that he has left
a large uneven thread, as you sometimes see in an unsaleable piece of
cambrick, running along the whole length of the web, and so untowardly,
you cannot so much as cut out a * *, (here I hang up a couple of
lights again)——or a fillet, or a thumb-stall, but it is seen
or <span class="locked">felt.———</span></p>
<p><i>Quanto id diligentius in liberis procreandis cavendum</i>, sayeth
<i>Cardan</i>. All which being considered, and that you see ’tis morally
impracticable for me to wind this round to where I set <span class="locked">out———</span></p>
<p>I begin the chapter over again.</p>
