<p><span class="firstword">When</span> <i>Trim</i> came in and told my
father, that Dr. <i>Slop</i> was in the kitchen, and busy in making a
bridge—my uncle <i>Toby</i>——the affair of the
jack-boots having just then raised a train of military ideas in his
brain——took it instantly for granted that Dr. <i>Slop</i>
was making a model of the marquis <i>d’Hôpital’s</i>
bridge.——’Tis very obliging in him, quoth my uncle
<i>Toby</i>;—pray give my humble service to Dr. <i>Slop</i>,
<i>Trim</i>, and tell him I thank him heartily.</p>
<p>Had my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> head been a <i>Savoyard’s</i> box, and my
father peeping in all the time at one end of it——it could
not have given him a more distinct conception of the operations of my
uncle <i>Toby’s</i> imagination, than what he had; so, notwithstanding
the catapulta and battering-ram, and his bitter imprecation about them,
he was just beginning to <span class="locked">triumph——</span></p>
<p>When <i>Trim’s</i> answer, in an instant, tore the laurel from his
brows, and twisted it to pieces.</p>
