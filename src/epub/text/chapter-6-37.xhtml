				<p>——<span class="firstword">’Twill</span> come out of itself by and bye.——All I contend for is, that I am not obliged to set out with a definition of what love is; and so long as I can go on with my story intelligibly, with the help of the word itself, without any other idea to it, than what I have in common with the rest of the world, why should I differ from it a moment before the time?——When I can get on no further,——and find myself entangled on all sides of this mystic labyrinth,—my Opinion will then come in, in course,—and lead me out.</p>
				<p>At present, I hope I shall be sufficiently understood, in telling the reader, my uncle <i>Toby fell in love</i>:</p>
				<p>—Not that the phrase is at all to my liking: for to say a man is <i>fallen</i> in love,—or that he is <i>deeply</i> in love,—or <ins class="correction" title="printed in plain (non-italic) type">up to the ears</ins> in love,—and sometimes even <i>over head and ears in it</i>,—carries an idiomatical kind of implication, that love is a thing <i>below</i> a man:—this is recurring again to <i>Plato’s</i> opinion, which, with all his divinityship,—I hold to be damnable and heretical:—and so much for that.</p>
				<p>Let love therefore be what it will,—my uncle <i>Toby</i> fell into it.</p>
				<p>——And possibly, gentle reader, with such a temptation—so wouldst thou: For never did thy eyes behold, or thy concupiscence covet anything in this world, more concupiscible than widow <i>Wadman</i>.</p>
