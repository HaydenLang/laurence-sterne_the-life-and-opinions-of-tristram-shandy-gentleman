<p>——<span class="firstword">What</span> a conjecture was
here lost!——My father in one of his best explanatory
moods—in eager pursuit of a metaphysical point into the very
regions, where clouds and thick darkness would soon have encompassed it
about;—my uncle <i>Toby</i> in one of the finest dispositions for
it in the world;—his head like a smoak-jack;——the
funnel unswept, and the ideas whirling round and round about in it, all
obfuscated and darkened over with fuliginous matter!—By the
tomb-stone of <i>Lucian</i>——if it is in
being——if not, why then by his ashes! by the ashes of my
dear <i>Rabelais</i>, and dearer
<i>Cervantes!</i>———my father and my uncle
<i>Toby’s</i> discourse upon <span class="smallroman">TIME</span> and
<span class="smallroman">ETERNITY</span>——was a discourse
devoutly to be wished for! and the petulancy of my father’s humour, in
putting a stop to it as he did, was a robbery of the <i>Ontologic
Treasury</i> of such a jewel, as no coalition of great occasions and
great men are ever likely to restore to it again.</p>
