				<p>——<span class="firstword">Now</span> this is the most puzzled skein of all——for in this last chapter, as far at least as it has help’d me through <i>Auxerre</i>, I have been getting forwards in two different journies together, and with the same dash of the pen—for I have got entirely out of <i>Auxerre</i> in this journey which I am writing now, and I am got half way out of <i>Auxerre</i> in that which I shall write hereafter——There is but a certain degree of perfection in everything; and by pushing at something beyond that, I have brought myself into such a situation, as no traveller ever stood before me; for I am this moment walking across the market-place of <i>Auxerre</i> with my father and my uncle <i>Toby</i>, in our way back to dinner——and I am this moment also entering <i>Lyons</i> with my post-chaise broke into a thousand pieces—and I am moreover this moment in a handsome pavillion built by <i>Pringello</i>,<a class="tag" href="#note_7_4" id="tag_7_4" name="tag_7_4">4</a> upon the banks of the <i>Garonne</i>, which Mons. <i>Sligniac</i> has lent me, and where I now sit rhapsodising all these affairs.</p>
				<p>——Let me collect myself, and pursue my journey.</p>
