<p><span class="firstword">The</span> gift of ratiocination and making
syllogisms——I mean in man—for in superior classes of
being, such as angels and spirits——’tis all done, may it
please your worships, as they tell me, by <span class="smallcaps">Intuition</span>;—and beings inferior, as your
worships all know——syllogize by their noses: though there is
an island swimming in the sea (though not altogether at its ease) whose
inhabitants, if my intelligence deceives me not, are so wonderfully
gifted, as to syllogize after the same fashion, and oft-times to make
very well out too:———but that’s neither here nor <span class="locked">there———</span></p>
<p>The gift of doing it as it should be, amongst us, or—the great
and principal act of ratiocination in man, as logicians tell us, is the
finding out the agreement or disagreement of two ideas one with another,
by the intervention of a third (called the <i>medius terminus</i>); just
as a man, as <i>Locke</i> well observes, by a yard, finds two men’s
nine-pin-alleys to be of the same length, which could not be brought
together, to measure their equality, by <i>juxta-position</i>.</p>
<p>Had the same great reasoner looked on, as my father illustrated his
systems of noses, and observed my uncle <i>Toby’s</i>
deportment—what great attention he gave to every word—and as
oft as he took his pipe from his mouth, with what wonderful seriousness
he contemplated the length of it——surveying it transversely
as he held it betwixt his finger and his thumb———then
fore-right———then this way, and then that, in all its
possible directions and foreshortenings———he would
have concluded my uncle <i>Toby</i> had got hold of the <i>medius
terminus</i>, and was syllogizing and measuring with it the truth of
each hypothesis of long noses, in order, as my father laid them before
him. This, by the bye, was more than my father wanted——his
aim in all the pains he was at in these philosophick lectures—was
to enable my uncle <i>Toby</i> not to <i>discuss</i>——but
<i>comprehend</i>——to <i>hold</i> the grains and scruples of
learning——not to <i>weigh</i> them.——My uncle
<i>Toby</i>, as you will read in the next chapter, did neither the one
or the other.</p>
