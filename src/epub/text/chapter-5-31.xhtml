<p><span class="firstword">The</span> first thirty pages, said my
father, turning over the leaves,—are a little dry; and as they are
not closely connected with the subject,——for the present
we’ll pass them by: ’tis a prefatory

introduction, continued my father, or an introductory preface (for I am
not determined which name to give it) upon political or civil
government; the foundation of which being laid in the first conjunction
betwixt male and female, for procreation of the
species——I was insensibly led into
it.——’Twas natural, said <i>Yorick</i>.</p>
<p>The original of society, continued my father, I’m satisfied is, what
<i>Politian</i> tells us, <i>i.e.</i>, merely conjugal; and nothing more
than the getting together of one man and one woman;—to which,
(according to <i>Hesiod</i>) the philosopher adds a
servant:——but supposing in the first beginning there were no
men servants born——he lays the foundation of it, in a
man,—a woman—and a bull.——I believe
’tis an ox, quoth <i>Yorick</i>, quoting the passage (<span class="greek" title="oikon men prôtista, gunaika te, boun t’ arotêra">οἶκον
μὲν πρώτιστα, <ins class="correction" title="printed γυνᾶικα">γυναῖκα</ins> τε, βοῦν τ’ <ins class="correction" title="printed ἀροτὴρα">ἀροτῆρα</ins></span>).——A bull must
have given more trouble than his head was worth.——But there
is a better reason still, said my father (dipping his pen into his ink);
for the ox being the most patient of animals, and the most useful withal
in tilling the ground for their nourishment,—was the properest
instrument, and emblem too, for the new joined couple, that the creation
could have associated with them.—And there is a stronger reason,
added my uncle <i>Toby</i>, than them all for the ox.—My father
had not power to take his pen out of his ink-horn, till he had heard my
uncle <i>Toby’s</i> reason.—For when the ground was tilled, said
my uncle <i>Toby</i>, and made worth inclosing, then they began to
secure it by walls and ditches, which was the origin of
fortification.——True, true, dear <i>Toby</i>, cried my
father, striking out the bull, and putting the ox in his place.</p>
<p>My father gave <i>Trim</i> a nod, to snuff the candle, and resumed
his discourse.</p>
<p>——I enter upon this speculation, said my father
carelessly, and half shutting the book, as he went on, merely to shew
the foundation of the natural relation between a father and his child;
the right and jurisdiction over whom he acquires these several <span class="locked">ways—</span></p>
<p>1st, by marriage.</p>
<p>2d, by adoption.</p>
<p>3d, by legitimation.</p>
<p>And 4th, by procreation; all which I consider in their order.</p>
<p>I lay a slight stress upon one of them, replied
<i>Yorick</i>——the act, especially where it ends there, in
my opinion lays as little obligation upon the child, as it conveys power
to the father.—You
<span class="pagenum">

are wrong,—said my father argutely, and for this plain reason<span id="plainreason"></span>

—I own, added my father, that the offspring, upon this
account, is not so under the power and jurisdiction of the
mother.—But the reason, replied <i>Yorick</i>, equally holds good
for her.——She is under authority herself, said my
father:—and besides, continued my father, nodding his head, and
laying his finger upon the side of his nose, as he assigned his
reason,—<i>she is not the principal agent</i>, Yorick.—In
what, quoth my uncle <i>Toby?</i> stopping his pipe.—Though by all
means, added my father (not attending to my uncle <i>Toby</i>) “<i>The
son ought to pay her respect</i>,” as you may read, <i>Yorick</i>, at
large in the first book of the Institutes of <i>Justinian</i>, at the
eleventh title and the tenth section,—I can read it as well,
replied <i>Yorick</i>, in the Catechism.<!-- </p> -->
