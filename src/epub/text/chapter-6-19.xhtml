<p><span class="firstword">After</span> my father had debated the
affair of the breeches with my mother,—he consulted <i>Albertus
Rubenius</i> upon it; and <i>Albertus Rubenius</i> used my father ten
times worse in the consultation (if possible) than even my father
had used my mother: For as <i>Rubenius</i> had wrote a quarto
<i>express</i>, <i>De re Vestiaria Veterum</i>,—it was
<i>Rubenius’s</i> business to have given my father some lights.—On
the contrary, my father might as well have thought of extracting the
seven cardinal virtues out of a long beard,—as of extracting a
single word out of <i>Rubenius</i> upon the subject.</p>
<p>Upon every other article of ancient dress, <i>Rubenius</i> was very
communicative to my father;—gave him a full and satisfactory
account of</p>
<div class="inset">
<p>The Toga, or loose gown.</p>
<p>The Chlamys.</p>
<p>The Ephod.</p>
<p>The Tunica, or Jacket.</p>
<p>The Synthesis.</p>
<p>The Pænula.</p>
<p>The Lacema, with its Cucullus.</p>
<p>The Paludamentum.</p>
<p>The Prætexta.</p>
<p>The Sagum, or soldier’s jerkin.</p>
<p>The Trabea: of which, according to <i>Suetonius</i>, there were three
<span class="locked">kinds.—</span></p>
</div>
<p>——But what are all these to the breeches? said my
father.</p>
<p><i>Rubenius</i> threw him down upon the counter all kinds of shoes
which had been in fashion with the <span class="locked"><i>Romans</i>.———</span></p>
<p class="plain">
There was,</p>
<div class="inset">
<div class="inset">
<p>The open shoe.</p>
<p>The close shoe.</p>
<p>The slip shoe.</p>
<p>The wooden shoe.</p>
<p>The soc.</p>
<p>The buskin.</p>
</div>
<p>And The military shoe with hobnails in it, which <i>Juvenal</i> takes
notice of.</p>
</div>
<span class="pagenum">
<a id="page324" name="page324">324</a></span>
<p class="plain">
There were, The clogs.</p>
<div class="inset">
<div class="inset">
<p>The pattins.</p>
<p>The pantoufles.</p>
<p>The brogues.</p>
<p>The sandals, with latchets to them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="plain">
There was, The felt shoe.</p>
<div class="inset">
<div class="inset">
<p>The linen shoe.</p>
<p>The laced shoe.</p>
<p>The braided shoe.</p>
<p>The calceus incisus.</p>
</div>
<p>And The calceus rostratus.</p>
</div>
<p><i>Rubenius</i> shewed my father how well they all fitted,—in
what manner they laced on,—with what points, straps, thongs,
latchets, ribbands, jaggs, and <span class="locked">ends.———</span></p>
<p>——But I want to be informed about the breeches, said my
father.</p>
<p><i>Albertus Rubenius</i> informed my father that the <i>Romans</i>
manufactured stuffs of various fabrics,——some
plain,—some striped,—others diapered throughout the whole
contexture of the wool, with silk and gold——That linen did
not begin to be in common use till towards the declension of the empire,
when the <i>Egyptians</i> coming to settle amongst them, brought it into
vogue.</p>
<p>——That persons of quality and fortune distinguished
themselves by the fineness and whiteness of their clothes; which colour
(next to purple, which was appropriated to the great offices) they most
affected, and wore on their birthdays and public
rejoicings.——That it appeared from the best historians of
those times, that they frequently sent their clothes to the fuller, to
be clean’d and whitened:——but that the inferior people, to
avoid that expence, generally wore brown clothes, and of a something
coarser texture,—till towards the beginning of <i>Augustus’s</i>
reign, when the slave dressed like his master, and almost every
distinction of habiliment was lost, but the <i>Latus Clavus</i>.</p>
<p>And what was the <i>Latus Clavus?</i> said my father.</p>
<p><i>Rubenius</i> told him, that the point was still litigating amongst
the learned:——That <i>Egnatius</i>, <i>Sigonius</i>,
<i>Bossius Ticinensis</i>, <i>Bayfius</i>, <i>Budæus</i>,
<i>Salmasius</i>, <i>Lipsius</i>, <i>Lazius</i>, <i>Isaac Casaubon</i>,
and <i>Joseph Scaliger</i>, all differed from each other,—and he
from them: That some took it to be the button,—some the coat
itself,—others only the colour of it:—That the great
<i>Bayfius</i>, in his Wardrobe of the Ancients, chap. 12—honestly
said, he
<span class="pagenum">
<a id="page325" name="page325">325</a></span>
knew not what it was,—whether a tibula,—a stud,—a
button,—a loop,—a buckle,—or clasps and
<span class="locked">keepers.———</span></p>
<p>——My father lost the horse, but not the
saddle——They are <i>hooks and eyes</i>, said my
father——and with hooks and eyes he ordered my breeches to be
made.</p>
