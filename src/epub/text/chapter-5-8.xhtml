<p><span class="firstword">Stay</span>——I have a small
account to settle with the reader before <i>Trim</i> can go on with his
harangue.—It shall be done in two minutes.</p>
<p>Amongst many other book-debts, all of which I shall discharge in due
time,—I own myself a debtor to the world for two
items,—a chapter upon <i>chamber-maids and button-holes</i>,
which, in the former part of my work, I promised and fully intended
to pay off this year: but some of your worships and reverences telling
me, that the two subjects, especially so connected together, might
endanger the morals of the world,—I pray the chapter
upon chamber-maids and button-holes may be forgiven me,—and that
they will accept of the last chapter in lieu of it; which is nothing,
an’t please your reverences, but a chapter of <i>chamber-maids, green
gowns, and old hats</i>.</p>
<p><i>Trim</i> took <ins class="correction" title="missing ‘hat’ may be intentional">his</ins> off the ground,—put it upon his
head,—and then went on with his oration upon death, in manner and
form following.</p>
