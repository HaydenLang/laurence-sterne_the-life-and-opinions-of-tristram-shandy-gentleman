<p><span class="firstword">If</span> it had not been for those two
mettlesome tits, and that madcap of a postillion who drove them from
Stilton to Stamford, the thought had never entered my head. He flew like
lightning——there was a slope of three miles and a
half——we scarce touched the ground——the motion
was most rapid——most impetuous———’twas
communicated to my brain—my heart partook of it——“By
the great God of day,” said I, looking towards the sun, and thrusting my
arm out of the fore-window of the chaise, as I made my vow, “I will
lock up my study-door the moment I get home, and throw the key of it
ninety feet below the surface of the earth, into the draw-well at the
back of my house.”</p>
<p>The London waggon confirmed me in my resolution; it hung tottering
upon the hill, scarce progressive, drag’d—drag’d up by eight
<i>heavy beasts</i>—“by main strength!——quoth I,
nodding——but your betters draw the same way——and
something of everybody’s!——O rare!”</p>
<p>Tell me, ye learned, shall we for ever be adding so much to the
<i>bulk</i>—so little to the <i>stock?</i></p>
<p>Shall we for ever make new books, as apothecaries make new mixtures,
by pouring only out of one vessel into another?</p>
<p>Are we for ever to be twisting, and untwisting the same rope? for
ever in the same track—for ever at the same pace?</p>
<p>Shall we be destined to the days of eternity, on holy-days, as well
as working-days, to be shewing the <i>relicks of learning</i>, as monks
do the relicks of their saints—without working one—one
single miracle with them?</p>
<p>Who made Man, with powers which dart him from earth to heaven in a
moment—that great, that most excellent, and most noble creature of
the world—the <i>miracle</i> of nature, as Zoroaster in his book
<span class="greek" title="peri phuseôs [missing accent as printed]">περι φύσεως</span> called him—the <span class="smallcaps">Shekinah</span> of the divine presence, as
Chrysostom——the <i>image</i> of God, as
Moses——the <i>ray</i> of divinity, as Plato—the
<i>marvel</i> of <i>marvels</i>, as Aristotle—to go sneaking on at
this pitiful—pimping—pettifogging rate?</p>
<p>I scorn to be as abusive as Horace upon the
occasion———but if there is no catachresis in the wish,
and no sin in it, I wish from my soul, that every imitator in
<i>Great Britain</i>, <i>France</i>, and <i>Ireland</i>, had the farcy
for his pains; and that there was a good farcical house, large enough to
hold—aye—and sublimate them, <i>shag rag and bob-tail</i>,
male and female, all together: and this leads me to the affair of
<i>Whiskers</i>——but, by what chain of
ideas—I leave as a legacy in <i>mort-main</i> to Prudes and
Tartufs, to enjoy and make the most of.</p>

<a id="bookV_whiskers" name="bookV_whiskers">UPON WHISKERS</a></h5>
<p>I’m sorry I made it——’twas as inconsiderate a promise as
ever entered a man’s head——A chapter upon whiskers!
alas! the world will not bear it—’tis a delicate
world——but I knew not of what mettle it was made—nor
had I ever seen the underwritten fragment; otherwise, as surely as noses
are noses, and whiskers are whiskers still (let the world say what it
will to the contrary); so surely would I have steered clear of this
dangerous chapter.</p>

———You are half asleep, my good lady, said the old
gentleman, taking hold of the old lady’s hand, and giving it a gentle
squeeze, as he pronounced the word <i>Whiskers</i>——shall we
change the subject? By no means, replied the old lady—I like
your account of those matters; so throwing a thin gauze handkerchief
over her head, and leaning it back upon the chair with her face turned
towards him, and advancing her two feet as she reclined
herself——I desire, continued she, you will
go on.<!-- </p> -->
<p>The old gentleman went on as follows:———Whiskers!
cried the queen of <i>Navarre</i>, dropping her knotting ball, as <i>La
Fosseuse</i> uttered the word——Whiskers, madam, said <i>La
Fosseuse</i>, pinning the ball to the queen’s apron, and making a
courtesy as she repeated it.</p>
<p><i>La Fosseuse’s</i> voice was naturally soft and low, yet ’twas an
articulate voice: and every letter of the word <i>Whiskers</i> fell
distinctly upon the queen of <i>Navarre’s</i> ear—Whiskers! cried
the queen, laying a greater stress upon the word, and as if she had
still distrusted her ears——Whiskers! replied <i>La
Fosseuse</i>, repeating the word a third time——There is not
a cavalier,
madam, of his age in <i>Navarre</i>, continued the maid of honour,
pressing the page’s interest upon the queen, that has so gallant a
pair——Of what? cried <i>Margaret</i>, smiling—Of
whiskers, said <i>La Fosseuse</i>, with infinite modesty.</p>
<p>The word <i>Whiskers</i> still stood its ground, and continued to be
made use of in most of the best companies throughout the little kingdom
of <i>Navarre</i>, notwithstanding the indiscreet use which <i>La
Fosseuse</i> had made of it: the truth was, <i>La Fosseuse</i> had
pronounced the word, not only before the queen, but upon sundry other
occasions at court, with an accent which always implied something of a
mystery—And as the court of <i>Margaret</i>, as all the world
knows, was at that time a mixture of gallantry and
devotion——and whiskers being as applicable to the one, as
the other, the word naturally stood its ground——it gain’d
full as much as it lost; that is, the clergy were for
it——the laity were against it——and for the
women,——<i>they</i> were divided.</p>
<p>The excellency of the figure and mien of the young Sieur <i>De
Croix</i>, was at that time beginning to draw the attention of the maids
of honour towards the terrace before the palace gate, where the guard
was mounted. The lady <i>De Baussiere</i> fell deeply in love with
him,——<i>La Battarelle</i> did the same—it was the
finest weather for it, that ever was remembered in
<i>Navarre</i>——<i>La Guyol</i>, <i>La Maronette</i>, <i>La
Sabatiere</i>, fell in love with the Sieur <i>De Croix</i>
also——<i>La Rebours</i> and <i>La Fosseuse</i> knew
better——<i>De Croix</i> had failed in an attempt to
recommend himself to <i>La Rebours</i>; and <i>La Rebours</i> and <i>La
Fosseuse</i> were inseparable.</p>
<p>The queen of <i>Navarre</i> was sitting with her ladies in the
painted bow-window, facing the gate of the second court, as <i>De
Croix</i> passed through it—He is handsome, said the Lady
<i>Baussiere</i>.——He has a good mien, said <i>La
Battarelle</i>——He is finely shaped, said <i>La
Guyol</i>—I never saw an officer of the horse-guards in my
life, said <i>La Maronette</i>, with two such legs——Or who
stood so well upon them, said <i>La
Sabatiere</i>———But he has no whiskers, cried <i>La
Fosseuse</i>——Not a pile, said <i>La Rebours</i>.</p>
<p>The queen went directly to her oratory, musing all the way, as she
walked through the gallery, upon the subject; turning it this way and
that way in her fancy—<i>Ave Maria!</i>———what
can <i>La Fosseuse</i> mean? said she, kneeling down upon the
cushion.</p>
<p><i>La Guyol</i>, <i>La Battarelle</i>, <i>La Maronette</i>, <i>La
Sabatiere</i>, retired instantly to their
chambers———Whiskers! said all four of them to
themselves, as they bolted their doors on the inside.</p>
<p>The Lady <i>Carnavallette</i> was counting her beads with both hands,
unsuspected, under her farthingal——from St. <i>Antony</i>
down to St. <i>Ursula</i> inclusive, not a saint passed through her
fingers without whiskers; St. <i>Francis</i>, St. <i>Dominick</i>, St.
<i>Bennet</i>, St. <i>Basil</i>, St. <i>Bridget</i>, had all
whiskers.</p>
<p>The Lady <i>Baussiere</i> had got into a wilderness of conceits, with
moralizing too intricately upon <i>La Fosseuse’s</i>
text——She mounted her palfrey, her page followed
her——the host passed by—the Lady <i>Baussiere</i>
rode on.</p>
<p>One denier, cried the order of mercy—one single denier, in
behalf of a thousand patient captives, whose eyes look towards heaven
and you for their redemption.</p>
<p>——The Lady <i>Baussiere</i> rode on.</p>
<p>Pity the unhappy, said a devout, venerable, hoary-headed man, meekly
holding up a box, begirt with iron, in his withered
hands——I beg for the unfortunate—good my Lady,
’tis for a prison—for an hospital—’tis for an old
man—a poor man undone by shipwreck, by suretyship, by
fire——I call God and all his angels to
witness——’tis to clothe the naked——to feed the
hungry——’tis to comfort the sick and the broken-hearted.</p>
<p>The Lady <i>Baussiere</i> rode on.</p>
<p>A decayed kinsman bowed himself to the ground.</p>
<p>——The Lady <i>Baussiere</i> rode on.</p>
<p>He ran begging bare-headed on one side of her palfrey, conjuring her
by the former bonds of friendship, alliance, consanguinity,
etc.——Cousin, aunt, sister, mother,——for
virtue’s sake, for your own, for mine, for Christ’s sake, remember
me——pity me.</p>
<p>——The Lady <i>Baussiere</i> rode on.</p>
<p>Take hold of my whiskers, said the Lady
<i>Baussiere</i>——The page took hold of her palfrey. She
dismounted at the end of the terrace.</p>
<p>There are some trains of certain ideas which leave prints of
themselves about our eyes and eye-brows; and there is a consciousness of
it, somewhere about the heart, which serves but to make these etchings
the stronger—we see, spell, and put them together without a
dictionary.</p>
<p>Ha, ha! he, hee! cried <i>La Guyol</i> and <i>La Sabatiere</i>,
looking close at each other’s prints——Ho, ho! cried <i>La
Battarelle</i> and <i>Maronette</i>, doing the same:—Whist! cried
one—st, st,—said a second—hush, quoth a
third—poo, poo, replied a fourth—gramercy! cried the Lady
<i>Carnavallette</i>;——’twas she who bewhisker’d St.
<i>Bridget</i>.</p>
<p><i>La Fosseuse</i> drew her bodkin from the knot of her hair, and
having traced the outline of a small whisker, with the blunt end of it,
upon one side of her upper lip, put it into <i>La Rebours’</i>
hand—<i>La Rebours</i> shook her head.</p>
<p>The Lady <i>Baussiere</i> coughed thrice into the inside of her
muff—<i>La Guyol</i> smiled—Fy, said the Lady
<i>Baussiere</i>. The queen of <i>Navarre</i> touched her eye with the
tip of her fore-finger—as much as to say, I understand you
all.</p>
<p>’Twas plain to the whole court the word was ruined: <i>La
Fosseuse</i> had given it a wound, and it was not the better for passing
through all these defiles——It made a faint stand, however,
for a few months, by the expiration of which, the Sieur <i>De Croix</i>,
finding it high time to leave <i>Navarre</i> for want of
whiskers——the word in course became indecent, and (after a
few efforts) absolutely unfit for use.</p>
<p>The best word, in the best language of the best world, must have
suffered under such combinations.———The curate of
<i>d’Estella</i> wrote a book against them, setting forth the dangers of
accessory ideas, and warning the <i>Navarois</i> against them.</p>
<p>Does not all the world know, said the curate <i>d’Estella</i> at the
conclusion of his work, that Noses ran the same fate some centuries ago
in most parts of <i>Europe</i>, which Whiskers have now done in the
kingdom of <i>Navarre?</i>—The evil indeed spread no farther
then—but have not beds and bolsters, and nightcaps and
chamber-pots stood upon the brink of destruction ever since? Are not
trouse, and placket-holes, and pump-handles—and spigots and
faucets, in danger still from the same
association?——Chastity, by nature, the gentlest of all
affections—give it but its head——’tis like a ramping
and a roaring lion.</p>
<p>The drift of the curate <i>d’Estella’s</i> argument was not
understood.—They ran the scent the wrong way.—The world
bridled his ass at the tail.—And when the <i>extremes</i> of <span class="smallroman">DELICACY</span>, and the <i>beginnings</i> of <span class="smallroman">CONCUPISCENCE</span>, hold their next provincial
chapter together, they may decree that bawdy also.</p>
