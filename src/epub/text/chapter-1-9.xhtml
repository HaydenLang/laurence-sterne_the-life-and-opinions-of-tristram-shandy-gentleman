<p><span class="firstword">I solemnly</span> declare to all mankind,
that the above dedication was made for no one Prince, Prelate, Pope, or
Potentate,—Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount, or Baron, of this, or
any other Realm in Christendom;——nor has it yet been hawked
about, or offered publicly or privately, directly or indirectly, to any
one person or personage, great or small; but is honestly a true
Virgin-Dedication untried on, upon any soul living.</p>
<p>I labour this point so particularly, merely to remove any offence or
objection which might arise against it from the manner in which I
propose to make the most of it;—which is the putting it up fairly
to public sale; which I now do.</p>
<p>——Every author has a way of his own in bringing his
points to bear;—for my own part, as I hate chaffering and higgling
for a few guineas in a dark entry;—I resolved within myself,
from the very beginning, to deal squarely and openly with your Great
Folks in this affair, and try whether I should not come off the better
by it.</p>
<p>If therefore there is any one Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount, or
Baron, in these his Majesty’s dominions, who stands in need of a tight,
genteel dedication, and whom the above will suit, (for by the bye,
unless it suits in some degree, I will not part
with it)——it is much at his service for fifty
guineas;——which I am positive is twenty guineas less than it
ought to be afforded for, by any man of genius.</p>
<p>My Lord, if you examine it over again, it is far from being a gross
piece of daubing, as some dedications are. The design, your Lordship
sees, is good,—the colouring transparent,—the drawing not
amiss;—or to speak more like a man of science,—and measure
my piece in the painter’s scale, divided into 20,—I believe,
my Lord, the outlines will turn out as 12,—the composition
as 9,—the colouring as 6,—the expression 13 and a
half,—and the design,—if I may be allowed, my Lord, to
understand my own <i>design</i>, and supposing absolute perfection in
designing, to be as 20,—I think it cannot well fall short of
19. Besides all this,—there is keeping in it, and the dark strokes
in the <span class="smallcaps">Hobby-Horse</span>, (which is a
secondary figure, and a kind of back-ground to the whole) give great
force to the principal lights in your own figure, and make it come off
wonderfully;——and besides, there is an air of originality in
the <i>tout ensemble</i>.</p>
<p>Be pleased, my good Lord, to order the sum to be paid into the hands
of Mr. <i>Dodsley</i>, for the benefit of the author; and in the next
edition care shall be taken that this chapter be expunged, and your
Lordship’s titles, distinctions, arms, and good actions, be placed at
the front of the preceding chapter: All which, from the words, <i>De
gustibus non est disputandum</i>, and whatever else in this book relates
to <span class="smallcaps">Hobby-Horses</span>, but no more, shall
stand dedicated to your Lordship.—The rest I dedicate to the <span class="smallcaps">Moon</span>, who, by the bye, of all the <span class="smallcaps">Patrons</span> or <span class="smallcaps">Matrons</span>
I can think of, has most power to set my book a-going, and make the
world run mad after it.</p>

<h4><a id="bookI_chapX" name="bookI_chapX">
CHAPTER X</a></h4>
<p><span class="firstword">Whatever</span> degree of small merit the
act of benignity in favour of the midwife might justly claim, or in whom
that claim truly rested,—at first sight seems not very material to
this history;——certain however it was, that the gentlewoman,
the parson’s wife, did run away at that time with the whole of it: And
yet, for my life, I cannot help thinking but that the parson
himself, though he had not the good fortune to hit upon the design
first,—yet, as he heartily concurred in it the moment it was laid
before him, and as heartily parted with his money to carry it into
execution, had a claim to some share of it,—if not to a full half
of whatever honour was due to it.</p>
<p>The world at that time was pleased to determine the matter
otherwise.</p>
<p>Lay down the book, and I will allow you half a day to give a probable
guess at the grounds of this procedure.</p>
<p>Be it known then, that, for about five years before the date of the
midwife’s licence, of which you have had so circumstantial an
account,—the parson we have to do with had made himself a
country-talk by a breach of all decorum, which he had committed against
himself, his station, and his office;—and that was in never
appearing better, or otherwise mounted, than upon a lean, sorry,
jack-ass of a horse, value about one pound fifteen shillings; who, to
shorten all description of him, was full brother to <i>Rosinante</i>, as
far as similitude congenial could make him; for he answered his
description to a hair-breadth in every thing,—except that I do not
remember ’tis any where said, that <i>Rosinante</i> was broken-winded;
and that, moreover, <i>Rosinante</i>, as is the happiness of most
<i>Spanish</i> horses, fat or lean,—was undoubtedly a horse at all
points.</p>
<p>I know very well that the <span class="smallcaps">Hero’s</span>
horse was a horse of chaste deportment, which may have given grounds for
the contrary opinion: But it is as certain at the same time, that
<i>Rosinante’s</i> continency (as may be demonstrated from the
adventure of the <i>Yanguesian</i> carriers) proceeded from no bodily
defect or cause whatsoever, but from the temperance and orderly current
of his blood.—And let me tell you, Madam, there is a great deal of
very good chastity in the world, in behalf of which you could not say
more for your life.</p>
<p>Let that be as it may, as my purpose is to do extra justice to every
creature brought upon the stage of this dramatic
work,—I could not stifle this distinction in favour of Don
<i>Quixote’s</i> horse;——in all other points, the parson’s
horse, I say, was just such another,—for he was as lean, and
as lank, and as sorry a jade, as <span class="smallcaps">Humility</span> herself could have bestrided.</p>
<p>In the estimation of here and there a man of weak judgment, it was
greatly in the parson’s power to have helped the figure of this horse of
his,—for he was master of a very handsome demi-peak’d saddle,
quilted on the seat with green plush, garnished with a double row of
silver-headed studs, and a noble pair of shining brass stirrups, with a
housing altogether suitable, of grey superfine cloth, with an edging of
black lace, terminating in a deep, black, silk fringe, <i>poudré
d’or</i>,—all which he had purchased in the pride and prime of his
life, together with a grand embossed bridle, ornamented at all points as
it should be.——But not caring to banter his beast, he had
hung all these up behind his study door:—and, in lieu of them, had
seriously
befitted him with just such a bridle and such a saddle, as the figure
and value of such a steed might well and truly deserve.</p>
<p>In the several sallies about his parish, and in the neighbouring
visits to the gentry who lived around him,—you will easily
comprehend, that the parson, so appointed, would both hear and see
enough to keep his philosophy from rusting. To speak the truth, he never
could enter a village, but he caught the attention of both old and
young.——Labour stood still as he pass’d——the
bucket hung suspended in the middle of the well,——the
spinning-wheel forgot its round,——even chuck-farthing and
shuffle-cap themselves stood gaping till he had got out of sight; and as
his movement was not of the quickest, he had generally time enough upon
his hands to make his observations,—to hear the groans of the
serious,—and the laughter of the light-hearted;—all which he
bore with excellent tranquillity.—His character was,—he
loved a jest in his heart—and as he saw himself in the true point
of ridicule, he would say he could not be angry with others for seeing
him in a light, in which he so strongly saw himself: So that to his
friends, who knew his foible was not the love of money, and who
therefore made the less scruple in bantering the extravagance of his
humour,—instead of giving the true cause,—he chose rather to
join in the laugh against himself; and as he never carried one single
ounce of flesh upon his own bones, being altogether as spare a figure as
his beast,—he would sometimes insist upon it, that the horse was
as good as the rider deserved;—that they were,
centaur-like,—both of a piece. At other times, and in other moods,
when his spirits were above the temptation of false wit,—he would
say, he found himself going off fast in a consumption; and, with great
gravity, would pretend, he could not bear the sight of a fat horse,
without a dejection of heart, and a sensible alteration in his pulse;
and that he had made choice of the lean one he rode upon, not only to
keep himself in countenance, but in spirits.</p>
<p>At different times he would give fifty humorous and apposite reasons
for riding a meek-spirited jade of a broken-winded horse, preferably to
one of mettle;—for on such a one he could sit mechanically, and
meditate as delightfully <i>de vanitate mundi et fugâ sæculi</i>, as
with the advantage of a death’s-head before him;—that, in all
other exercitations, he could spend his time, as he rode slowly
along,—to as much account as in his study;—that he could
draw up an argument in his sermon,—or a hole in his breeches, as
steadily on the one as in the other;—that brisk
trotting and slow argumentation, like wit and judgment, were two
incompatible movements.—But that upon his steed—he could
unite and reconcile every thing,—he could compose his
sermon—he could compose his cough,——and, in case
nature gave a call that way, he could likewise compose himself to
sleep.—In short, the parson upon such encounters would assign any
cause but the true cause,—and he with-held the true one, only out
of a nicety of temper, because he thought it did honour to him.</p>
<p>But the truth of the story was as follows: In the first years of this
gentleman’s life, and about the time when the superb saddle and bridle
were purchased by him, it had been his manner, or vanity, or call it
what you will,—to run into the opposite extreme.—In the
language of the county where he dwelt, he was said to have loved a good
horse, and generally had one of the best in the whole parish standing in
his stable always ready for saddling; and as the nearest midwife, as I
told you, did not live nearer to the village than seven miles, and in a
vile country,—it so fell out that the poor gentleman was scarce a
whole week together without some piteous application for his beast; and
as he was not an unkind-hearted man, and every case was more pressing
and more distressful than the last,—as much as he loved his beast,
he had never a heart to refuse him; the upshot of which was generally
this, that his horse was either clapp’d, or spavin’d, or
greaz’d;—or he was twitter-bon’d, or broken-winded, or something,
in short, or other had befallen him, which would let him carry no
flesh;—so that he had every nine or ten months a bad horse to get
rid of,—and a good horse to purchase in his stead.</p>
<p>What the loss on such a balance might amount to, <i>communibus
annis</i>, I would leave to a special jury of sufferers in the same
traffick, to determine;—but let it be what it would, the honest
gentleman bore it for many years without a murmur, till at length, by
repeated ill accidents of the kind, he found it necessary to take the
thing under consideration; and upon weighing the whole, and summing it
up in his mind, he found it not only disproportioned to his other
expences, but withal so heavy an article in itself, as to disable him
from any other act of generosity in his parish: Besides this, he
considered that with half the sum thus galloped away, he could do ten
times as much good;—and what still weighed more with him than all
other considerations put together, was this, that it confined all his
charity into one particular channel, and where, as he fancied, it was
the least
wanted, namely, to the child-bearing and child-getting part of his
parish; reserving nothing for the impotent,—nothing for the
aged,—nothing for the many comfortless scenes he was hourly called
forth to visit, where poverty, and sickness, and affliction dwelt
together.</p>
<p>For these reasons he resolved to discontinue the expence; and there
appeared but two possible ways to extricate him clearly out of
it;—and these were, either to make it an irrevocable law never
more to lend his steed upon any application whatever,—or else be
content to ride the last poor devil, such as they had made him, with all
his aches and infirmities, to the very end of the chapter.</p>
<p>As he dreaded his own constancy in the first—he very chearfully
betook himself to the second; and though he could very well have
explained it, as I said, to his honour,—yet, for that very reason,
he had a spirit above it; choosing rather to bear the contempt of his
enemies, and the laughter of his friends, than undergo the pain of
telling a story, which might seem a panegyrick upon himself.</p>
<p>I have the highest idea of the spiritual and refined sentiments of
this reverend gentleman, from this single stroke in his character, which
I think comes up to any of the honest refinements of the peerless knight
of <i>La Mancha</i>, whom, by the bye, with all his follies, I love
more, and would actually have gone farther to have paid a visit to, than
the greatest hero of antiquity.</p>
<p>But this is not the moral of my story: The thing I had in view was to
shew the temper of the world in the whole of this affair.—For you
must know, that so long as this explanation would have done the parson
credit,—the devil a soul could find it out,—I suppose
his enemies would not, and that his friends could not.——But
no sooner did he bestir himself in behalf of the midwife, and pay the
expences of the ordinary’s licence to set her up,—but the whole
secret came out; every horse he had lost, and two horses more than ever
he had lost, with all the circumstances of their destruction, were known
and distinctly remembered.—The story ran like wild-fire—“The
parson had a returning fit of pride which had just seized him; and he
was going to be well mounted once again in his life; and if it was so,
’twas plain as the sun at noon-day, he would pocket the expence of the
licence, ten times told, the very first year:—So that every body
was left to judge what were his views in this act of charity.”</p>
<p>What were his views in this, and in every other action of his
life,—or rather what were the opinions which floated in the brains
of other people concerning it, was a thought which too much floated in
his own, and too often broke in upon his rest, when he should have been
sound asleep.</p>
<p>About ten years ago this gentleman had the good fortune to be made
entirely easy upon that score,—it being just so long since he left
his parish,—and the whole world at the same time behind
him,—and stands accountable to a Judge of whom he will have no
cause to complain.</p>
<p>But there is a fatality attends the actions of some men: Order them
as they will, they pass thro’ a certain medium, which so twists and
refracts them from their true directions——that, with all the
titles to praise which a rectitude of heart can give, the doers of them
are nevertheless forced to live and die without it.</p>
<p>Of the truth of which, this gentleman was a painful
example.——But to know by what means this came to
pass,—and to make that knowledge of use to you, I insist upon
it that you read the two following chapters, which contain such a sketch
of his life and conversation, as will carry its moral along with
it.—When this is done, if nothing stops us in our way, we will go
on with the midwife.</p>
<h4><a id="bookI_chapXI" name="bookI_chapXI">
CHAPTER XI</a></h4>
<p><span class="firstword">Yorick</span> was this parson’s name, and,
what is very remarkable in it (as appears from a most ancient
account of the family, wrote upon strong vellum, and now in perfect
preservation) it had been exactly so spelt for
near,——I was within an ace of saying nine hundred
years;——but I would not shake my credit in telling an
improbable truth, however indisputable in itself;——and
therefore I shall content myself with only saying——It had
been exactly so spelt, without the least variation or transposition of a
single letter, for I do not know how long; which is more than I would
venture to say of one half of the best surnames in the kingdom; which,
in a course of years, have generally undergone as many chops and changes
as their owners.—Has this been owing to the pride, or to the shame
of the respective proprietors?—In honest truth, I think
sometimes to the one, and sometimes to the other, just as the temptation
has wrought. But a villainous affair it is, and will one day so blend
and confound us altogether, that no one shall be able to stand up and
swear, “That his own great grandfather was the man who did either this
or that.”</p>
<p>This evil had been sufficiently fenced against by the prudent care of
the <i>Yorick’s</i> family, and their religious preservation of these
records I quote, which do farther inform us, That the family was
originally of <i>Danish</i> extraction, and had been transplanted into
<i>England</i> as early as in the reign of <i>Horwendillus</i>, king of
<i>Denmark</i>, in whose court, it seems, an ancestor of this Mr.
<i>Yorick’s</i>, and from whom he was lineally descended, held a
considerable post to the day of his death. Of what nature this
considerable post was, this record saith not;—It only adds, That,
for near two centuries, it had been totally abolished, as altogether
unnecessary, not only in that court, but in every other court of the
Christian world.</p>
<p>It has often come into my head, that this post could be no other than
that of the king’s chief Jester;—and that <i>Hamlet’s Yorick</i>,
in our <i>Shakespeare</i>, many of whose plays, you know, are founded
upon authenticated facts, was certainly the very man.</p>
<p>I have not the time to look into <i>Saxo-Grammaticus’s Danish</i>
history, to know the certainty of this;—but if you have leisure,
and can easily get at the book, you may do it full as well yourself.</p>
<p>I had just time, in my travels through <i>Denmark</i> with Mr.
<i>Noddy’s</i> eldest son, whom, in the year 1741, I accompanied as
governor, riding along with him at a prodigious rate thro’ most parts of
<i>Europe</i>, and of which original journey performed by us two,
a most delectable narrative will be given in the progress of this
work; I had just time, I say, and that was all, to prove the
truth of an observation made by a long sojourner in that
country;——namely, “That nature was neither very lavish, nor
was she very stingy in her gifts of genius and capacity to its
inhabitants;—but, like a discreet parent, was moderately kind to
them all; observing such an equal tenor in the distribution of her
favours, as to bring them, in those points, pretty near to a level with
each other; so that you will meet with few instances in that kingdom of
refined parts; but a great deal of good plain household understanding
amongst all ranks of people, of which everybody has a share;” which is,
I think, very right.</p>
<p>With us, you see, the case is quite different:—we are all ups
and downs in this matter;—you are a great genius;—or ’tis
fifty to one, Sir, you are a great dunce and a blockhead;—not that
there is a total want of intermediate steps,—no,—we are not
so irregular as that comes to;—but the two extremes are
more common, and in a greater degree in this unsettled island, where
nature, in her gifts and dispositions of this kind, is most whimsical
and capricious; fortune herself not being more so in the bequest of her
goods and chattels than she.</p>
<p>This is all that ever staggered my faith in regard to <i>Yorick’s</i>
extraction, who, by what I can remember of him, and by all the accounts
I could ever get of him, seemed not to have had one single drop of
<i>Danish</i> blood in his whole crasis; in nine hundred years, it might
possibly have all run out:——I will not philosophize one
moment with you about it; for happen how it would, the fact was
this:—That instead of that cold phlegm and exact regularity of
sense and humours, you would have looked for, in one so
extracted;—he was, on the contrary, as mercurial and sublimated a
composition,—as heteroclite a creature in all his
declensions;—with as much life and whim, and <i>gaité de cœur</i>
about him, as the kindliest climate could have engendered and put
together. With all this sail, poor <i>Yorick</i> carried not one ounce
of ballast; he was utterly unpractised in the world; and, at the age of
twenty-six, knew just about as well how to steer his course in it, as a
romping, unsuspicious girl of thirteen: So that upon his first setting
out, the brisk gale of his spirits, as you will imagine, ran him foul
ten times in a day of somebody’s tackling; and as the grave and more
slow-paced were oftenest in his way,——you may likewise
imagine, ’twas with such he had generally the ill luck to get the most
entangled. For aught I know there might be some mixture of unlucky wit
at the bottom of such <i>Fracas</i>:——For, to speak the
truth, <i>Yorick</i> had an invincible dislike and opposition in his
nature to gravity;—not to gravity as such;—for where gravity
was wanted, he would be the most grave or serious of mortal men for days
and weeks together;—but he was an enemy to the affectation of it,
and declared open war against it, only as it appeared a cloak for
ignorance, or for folly: and then, whenever it fell in his way, however
sheltered and protected, he seldom gave it much quarter.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in his wild way of talking, he would say that Gravity was
an errant scoundrel, and he would add,—of the most dangerous kind
too,—because a sly one; and that he verily believed, more honest,
well-meaning people were bubbled out of their goods and money by it in
one twelve-month, than by pocket-picking and shop-lifting in seven. In
the naked temper which a merry heart discovered, he would say, there was
no danger,—but to itself:—whereas the very essence of
gravity was
design, and consequently deceit;—’twas a taught trick to gain
credit of the world for more sense and knowledge than a man was worth;
and that, with all its pretensions,—it was no better, but often
worse, than what a <i>French</i> wit had long ago defined
it,—<i>viz.</i> <i>A mysterious carriage of the body to cover the
defects of the mind</i>;—which definition of gravity,
<i>Yorick</i>, with great imprudence, would say, deserved to be wrote in
letters of gold.</p>
<p>But, in plain truth, he was a man unhackneyed and unpractised in the
world, and was altogether as indiscreet and foolish on every other
subject of discourse where policy is wont to impress restraint.
<i>Yorick</i> had no impression but one, and that was what arose from
the nature of the deed spoken of; which impression he would usually
translate into plain <i>English</i> without any periphrasis;—and
too oft without much distinction of either person, time, or
place;—so that when mention was made of a pitiful or an ungenerous
proceeding——he never gave himself a moment’s time to reflect
who was the hero of the piece,——what his
station,——or how far he had power to hurt him
hereafter;——but if it was a dirty action,—without more
ado,—The man was a dirty fellow,—and so on.—And as his
comments had usually the ill fate to be terminated either in a <i>bon
mot</i>, or to be enlivened throughout with some drollery or humour of
expression, it gave wings to <i>Yorick’s</i> indiscretion. In a word,
tho’ he never sought, yet, at the same time, as he seldom shunned
occasions of saying what came uppermost, and without much
ceremony;——he had but too many temptations in life, of
scattering his wit and his humour,—his gibes and his jests about
him.——They were not lost for want of gathering.</p>
<p>What were the consequences, and what was <i>Yorick’s</i> catastrophe
thereupon, you will read in the next chapter.</p>
<h4><a id="bookI_chapXII" name="bookI_chapXII">
CHAPTER XII</a></h4>
<p><span class="firstword">The</span> <i>Mortgager</i> and
<i>Mortgagée</i> differ the one from the other, not more in length of
purse, than the <i>Jester</i> and <i>Jestée</i> do, in that of memory.
But in this the comparison between them runs, as the scholiasts call it,
upon all-four; which, by the bye, is upon one or two legs more than some
of the best of <i>Homer’s</i> can pretend to;—namely, That the one
raises a sum, and the other a laugh at your expence, and thinks no more
about it. Interest, however, still runs on in both cases;—the
periodical or accidental
payments of it, just serving to keep the memory of the affair alive;
till, at length, in some evil hour,—pop comes the creditor upon
each, and by demanding principal upon the spot, together with full
interest to the very day, makes them both feel the full extent of their
obligations.</p>
<p>As the reader (for I hate your <i>ifs</i>) has a thorough knowledge
of human nature, I need not say more to satisfy him, that my <span class="smallcaps">Hero</span> could not go on at this rate without
some slight experience of these incidental mementos. To speak the truth,
he had wantonly involved himself in a multitude of small book-debts of
this stamp, which, notwithstanding <i>Eugenius’s</i> frequent advice, he
too much disregarded; thinking, that as not one of them was contracted
thro’ any malignancy;—but, on the contrary, from an honesty of
mind, and a mere jocundity of humour, they would all of them be cross’d
out in course.</p>
<p><i>Eugenius</i> would never admit this; and would often tell him,
that one day or other he would certainly be reckoned with; and he would
often add, in an accent of sorrowful apprehension,—to the
uttermost mite. To which <i>Yorick</i>, with his usual carelessness of
heart, would as often answer with a pshaw!—and if the subject was
started in the fields—with a hop, skip, and a jump at the end of
it; but if close pent up in the social chimney-corner, where the culprit
was barricado’d in, with a table and a couple of armchairs, and could
not so readily fly off in a tangent,—<i>Eugenius</i> would then go
on with his lecture upon discretion in words to this purpose, though
somewhat better put together.</p>
<p>Trust me, dear <i>Yorick</i>, this unwary pleasantry of thine will
sooner or later bring thee into scrapes and difficulties, which no
after-wit can extricate thee out of.——In these sallies, too
oft, I see, it happens, that a person laughed at, considers himself
in the light of a person injured, with all the rights of such a
situation belonging to him; and when thou viewest him in that light too,
and reckons up his friends, his family, his kindred and
allies,——and musters up with them the many recruits which
will list under him from a sense of common danger;——’tis no
extravagant arithmetick to say, that for every ten jokes,—thou
hast got an hundred enemies; and till thou hast gone on, and raised a
swarm of wasps about thine ears, and art half stung to death by them,
thou wilt never be convinced it is so.</p>
<p>I cannot suspect it in the man whom I esteem, that there is the least
spur from spleen or malevolence of intent in these
sallies——I believe and know them to be truly honest and
sportive:—But consider, my dear lad, that fools cannot distinguish
this,—and that knaves will not: and thou knowest not what it is,
either to provoke the one, or to make merry with the
other:——whenever they associate for mutual defence, depend
upon it, they will carry on the war in such a manner against thee, my
dear friend, as to make thee heartily sick of it, and of thy life
too.</p>
<p>Revenge from some baneful corner shall level a tale of dishonour at
thee, which no innocence of heart or integrity of conduct shall set
right.——The fortunes of thy house shall totter,—thy
character, which led the way to them, shall bleed on every side of
it,—thy faith questioned,—thy works belied,—thy wit
forgotten,—thy learning trampled on. To wind up the last scene of
thy tragedy, <span class="smallcaps">Cruelty</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Cowardice</span>, twin ruffians, hired and set on by <span class="smallcaps">Malice</span> in the dark, shall strike together at
all thy infirmities and mistakes:——The best of us, my dear
lad, lie open there,——and trust me,——trust me,
<i>Yorick, when to gratify a private appetite, it is once resolved upon,
that an innocent and an helpless creature shall be sacrificed, ’tis an
easy matter to pick up sticks enough from any thicket where it has
strayed, to make a fire to offer it up with</i>.</p>
<p><i>Yorick</i> scarce ever heard this sad vaticination of his destiny
read over to him, but with a fear stealing from his eye, and a
promissory look attending it, that he was resolved, for the time to
come, to ride his tit with more sobriety.—But, alas, too
late!—a grand confederacy, with ***** and ***** at the head
of it, was formed before the first prediction of it.—The whole
plan of the attack, just as <i>Eugenius</i> had foreboded, was put in
execution all at once,—with so little mercy on the side of the
allies,—and so little suspicion in <i>Yorick</i>, of what was
carrying on against him,—that when he thought, good easy man! full
surely preferment was o’ ripening,—they had smote his root, and
then he fell, as many a worthy man had fallen before him.</p>
<p><i>Yorick</i>, however, fought it out with all imaginable gallantry
for some time; till, overpowered by numbers, and worn out at length by
the calamities of the war,—but more so, by the ungenerous manner
in which it was carried on,—he threw down the sword; and though he
kept up his spirits in appearance to the last, he died, nevertheless, as
was generally thought, quite broken-hearted.</p>
<p>What inclined <i>Eugenius</i> to the same opinion was as follows:</p>
<p>A few hours before <i>Yorick</i> breathed his last, <i>Eugenius</i>
stept in with an intent to take his last sight and last farewell of him.
Upon his drawing <i>Yorick’s</i> curtain, and asking how he felt
himself, <i>Yorick</i> looking up in his face took hold of his
hand,—and after thanking him for the many tokens of his friendship
to him, for which, he said, if it was their fate to meet
hereafter,—he would thank him again and again,—he told him,
he was within a few hours of giving his enemies the slip for
ever.—I hope not, answered <i>Eugenius</i>, with tears
trickling down his cheeks, and with the tenderest tone that ever man
spoke.—I hope not, <i>Yorick</i>, said
he.——<i>Yorick</i> replied, with a look up, and a gentle
squeeze of <i>Eugenius’s</i> hand, and that was all,—but it cut
<i>Eugenius</i> to his heart,—Come—come, <i>Yorick</i>,
quoth <i>Eugenius</i>, wiping his eyes, and summoning up the man within
him,—my dear lad, be comforted,—let not all thy spirits and
fortitude forsake thee at this crisis when thou most wants
them;——who knows what resources are in store, and what the
power of God may yet do for thee?——<i>Yorick</i> laid his
hand upon his heart, and gently shook his head;—For my part,
continued <i>Eugenius</i>, crying bitterly as he uttered the
words,—I declare I know not, <i>Yorick</i>, how to part with
thee, and would gladly flatter my hopes, added <i>Eugenius</i>, chearing
up his voice, that there is still enough left of thee to make a bishop,
and that I may live to see it.——I beseech thee,
<i>Eugenius</i>, quoth <i>Yorick</i>, taking off his night-cap as well
as he could with his left hand,——his right being still
grasped close in that of <i>Eugenius</i>,——I beseech
thee to take a view of my head.—I see nothing that ails it,
replied <i>Eugenius</i>. Then, alas! my friend, said <i>Yorick</i>, let
me tell you, that ’tis so bruised and mis-shapened with the blows which
***** and *****, and some others have so unhandsomely given me, in the
dark, that I might say with <i>Sancho Pança</i>, that should I recover,
and “Mitres thereupon be suffered to rain down from heaven as thick as
hail, not one of them would fit it.”——<i>Yorick’s</i> last
breath was hanging upon his trembling lips ready to depart as he uttered
this:——yet still it was uttered with something of a
<i>Cervantick</i> tone;——and as he spoke it, <i>Eugenius</i>
could perceive a stream of lambent fire lighted up for a moment in his
eyes;——faint picture of those flashes of his spirit, which
(as <i>Shakespeare</i> said of his ancestor) were wont to set the
table in a roar!</p>
<p><i>Eugenius</i> was convinced from this, that the heart of his friend
was broke: he squeezed his hand,——and then walked softly out
of the room, weeping as he walked. <i>Yorick</i> followed
<i>Eugenius</i> with his eyes to the door,—he then closed
them,—and never opened them more.</p>

<p>He lies buried in the corner of his churchyard, in the parish of
———, under a plain marble slab, which his friend
<i>Eugenius</i>, by leave of his executors, laid upon his grave, with no
more than these three words of inscription, serving both for his epitaph
and elegy.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="center">
Alas, poor YORICK!</p></div>
<p>Ten times a day has <i>Yorick’s</i> ghost the consolation to hear his
monumental inscription read over with such a variety of plaintive tones,
as denote a general pity and esteem for
him;——a foot-way crossing the churchyard close by the
side of his grave,—not a passenger goes by without stopping to
cast a look upon it,—and sighing as he walks on,</p>

CHAPTER XIII</a></h4>
<p><span class="firstword">It</span> is so long since the reader of
this rhapsodical work has been parted from the midwife, that it is high
time to mention her again to him, merely to put him in mind that there
is such a body still in the world, and whom, upon the best judgment I
can form upon my own plan at present,—I am going to introduce
to him for good and all: But as fresh matter may be started, and much
unexpected business fall out betwixt the reader and myself, which may
require immediate dispatch;——’twas right to take care that
the poor woman should not be lost in the meantime;—because when
she is wanted, we can no way do without her.</p>
<p>I think I told you that this good woman was a person of no small note
and consequence throughout our whole village and township;—that
her fame had spread itself to the very out-edge and circumference of
that circle of importance, of which kind every soul living, whether he
has a shirt to his back or no,——has one surrounding
him;—which said circle, by the way, whenever ’tis said that such a
one is of great weight and importance in the
<i>world</i>,——I desire may be enlarged or contracted
in your worship’s fancy, in a compound ratio of the station, profession,
knowledge, abilities, height and depth (measuring both ways) of the
personage brought before you.</p>
<p>In the present case, if I remember, I fixed it about four or five
miles, which not only comprehended the whole parish, but extended itself
to two or three of the adjacent hamlets in the skirts of the next
parish; which made a considerable thing of it. I must add, That she
was, moreover, very well looked on at one large grange-house, and some
other odd houses and farms within two or three miles, as I said, from
the smoke of her own chimney:——But I must here, once for
all, inform you, that all this will be more exactly delineated and
explain’d in a map, now in the hands of the engraver, which, with many
other pieces and developements of this work, will be added to the end of
the twentieth volume,—not to swell the work,—I detest
the thought of such a thing;—but by way of commentary, scholium,
illustration, and key to such passages, incidents, or innuendos as shall
be thought to be either of private interpretation, or of dark or
doubtful meaning, after my life and my opinions shall have been read
over (now don’t forget the meaning of the word) by all the
<i>world</i>;——which, betwixt you and me, and in spite of
all the gentlemen-reviewers in <i>Great Britain</i>, and of all that
their worships shall undertake to write or say to the
contrary,—I am determined shall be the
case.—I need not tell your worship, that all this is spoke in

CHAPTER XIV</a></h4>
<p><span class="firstword">Upon</span> looking into my mother’s
marriage-settlement, in order to satisfy myself and reader in a point
necessary to be cleared up, before we could proceed any farther in this
history;—I had the good fortune to pop upon the very thing I
wanted before I had read a day and a half straight forwards,—it
might have taken me up a month;—which shews plainly, that when a
man sits down to write a history,—tho’ it be but the history of
<i>Jack Hickathrift</i> or <i>Tom Thumb</i>, he knows no more than his
heels what lets and confounded hindrances he is to meet with in his
way,—or what a dance he may be led, by one excursion or another,
before all is over. Could a historiographer drive on his history, as a
muleteer drives on his mule,—straight forward;——for
instance, from <i>Rome</i> all the way to <i>Loretto</i>, without ever
once turning his head aside either to the right hand or to the
left,——he might venture to foretell you to an hour when he
should get to his journey’s end;——but the thing is, morally
speaking, impossible: For, if he is a man of the least spirit, he will
have fifty deviations from a straight line to make with this or that
party as he goes along, which he can no ways avoid. He will have views
and prospects to himself perpetually soliciting his eye, which he can no
more help standing still to look at than he can fly; he will moreover
have various</p>
<p>Accounts to reconcile:</p>
<p>Anecdotes to pick up:</p>
<p>Inscriptions to make out:</p>
<p>Stories to weave in:</p>
<p>Traditions to sift:</p>
<p>Personages to call upon:</p>
<p>Panegyricks to paste up at this door;</p>
<p>Pasquinades at that:——All which both the man and his mule
are quite exempt from. To sum up all; there are archives at every stage
to be look’d into, and rolls, records, documents, and endless
genealogies, which justice ever and anon calls him back to stay the
reading of:——In short, there is no end of
it;——for
my own part, I declare I had been at it these six weeks, making all
the speed I possibly could,—and am not yet born:—I have
just been able, and that’s all, to tell you <i>when</i> it happen’d, but
not <i>how</i>;—so that you see the thing is yet far from being
accomplished.</p>
<p>These unforeseen stoppages, which I own I had no conception of when I
first set out;—but which, I am convinced now, will rather
increase than diminish as I advance,—have struck out a hint which
I am resolved to follow;——and that is,—not to be in a
hurry; but to go on leisurely, writing and publishing two volumes of my
life every year;——which, if I am suffered to go on quietly,
and can make a tolerable bargain with my bookseller, I shall
continue to do as long as I live.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">The</span> article in my mother’s
marriage-settlement, which I told the reader I was at the pains to
search for, and which, now that I have found it, I think proper to
lay before him,—is so much more fully express’d in the deed
itself, than ever I can pretend to do it, that it would be barbarity to
take it out of the lawyer’s hand:—It is as follows.</p>
<p>“<span class="blackletter">And this Indenture further

consideration of the said intended marriage to be had, and, by God’s

also</span> the advowson, donation, presentation, and free disposition
of the rectory or parsonage of <i>Shandy</i> aforesaid, and all and
every the tenths, tythes, glebe-lands.”——In three
words,——“My mother was to lay in, (if she
chose it) in <i>London</i>.”</p>
<p>But in order to put a stop to the practice of any unfair play on the
part of my mother, which a marriage-article of this nature too
manifestly opened a door to, and which indeed had never been thought of
at all, but for my uncle <i>Toby Shandy</i>;—a clause was
added in security of my father, which was this:—“That in case my
mother hereafter should, at any time, put my father to the trouble and
expence of a <i>London</i> journey, upon false cries and
tokens;——that for every such instance, she should forfeit
all the right and title which the covenant gave her to the next
turn;——but to no more,—and so on, <i>toties
quoties</i>, in as effectual a manner, as if such a covenant betwixt
them had not been made.”—This, by the way, was no more than what
was reasonable;—and yet, as reasonable as it was, I have ever
thought it hard that the whole weight of the article should have fallen
entirely, as it did, upon myself.</p>
<p>But I was begot and born to misfortunes:—for my poor mother,
whether it was wind or water—or a compound of both,—or
neither;—or whether it was simply the mere swell of imagination
and fancy in her;—or how far a strong wish and
desire to have it so, might mislead her judgment:—in short,
whether she was deceived or deceiving in this matter, it no way becomes
me to decide. The fact was this, That in the latter end of
<i>September</i> 1717, which was the year before I was born, my mother
having carried my father up to town much against the grain,—he
peremptorily insisted upon the clause;—so that I was doom’d, by
marriage-articles, to have my nose squeez’d as flat to my face, as if
the destinies had actually spun me without one.</p>
<p>How this event came about,—and what a train of vexatious
disappointments, in one stage or other of my life, have pursued me from
the mere loss, or rather compression, of this one single
member,—shall be laid before the reader all in due time.</p>
<h4><a id="bookI_chapXVI" name="bookI_chapXVI">
CHAPTER XVI</a></h4>
<p><span class="firstword">My</span> father, as anybody may naturally
imagine, came down with my mother into the country, in but a pettish
kind of a humour. The first twenty or five-and-twenty miles he did
nothing in the world but fret and teaze himself, and indeed my mother
too, about the cursed expence, which he said might every shilling of it
have been saved;—then what vexed him more than everything else
was, the provoking time of the year,—which, as I told you, was
towards the end of <i>September</i>, when his wall-fruit and green gages
especially, in which he was very curious, were just ready for
pulling:——“Had he been whistled up to <i>London</i>, upon a
<i>Tom Fool’s</i> errand, in any other month of the whole year, he
should not have said three words about it.”</p>
<p>For the next two whole stages, no subject would go down, but the
heavy blow he had sustain’d from the loss of a son, whom it seems he had
fully reckon’d upon in his mind, and register’d down in his pocket-book,
as a second staff for his old age, in case <i>Bobby</i> should fail him.
The disappointment of this, he said, was ten times more to a wise man,
than all the money which the journey, etc., had cost him, put
together,—rot the hundred and twenty pounds,——he did
not mind it a rush.</p>
<p>From <i>Stilton</i>, all the way to <i>Grantham</i>, nothing in the
whole affair provoked him so much as the condolences of his friends, and
the foolish figure they should both make at church, the first
<i>Sunday</i>;——of which, in the satirical vehemence of his
wit, now sharpen’d a little by vexation, he would give so many humorous
and provoking descriptions,—and place his rib and
self in so many tormenting lights and attitudes in the face of the whole
congregation;—that my mother declared, these two stages were so
truly tragi-comical, that she did nothing but laugh and cry in a breath,
from one end to the other of them all the way.</p>
<p>From <i>Grantham</i>, till they had cross’d the <i>Trent</i>, my
father was out of all kind of patience at the vile trick and imposition
which he fancied my mother had put upon him in this
affair—“Certainly,” he would say to himself, over and over again,
“the woman could not be deceived herself——if she
could,——what weakness!”—tormenting word!—which
led his imagination a thorny dance, and, before all was over, play’d the
duce and all with him;——for sure as ever the word
<i>weakness</i> was uttered, and struck full upon his brain—so
sure it set him upon running divisions upon how many kinds of weaknesses
there were;——that there was such a thing as weakness of the
body,——as well as weakness of the mind,—and then he
would do nothing but syllogize within himself for a stage or two
together, How far the cause of all these vexations might, or might not,
have arisen out of himself.</p>
<p>In short, he had so many little subjects of disquietude springing out
of this one affair, all fretting successively in his mind as they rose
up in it, that my mother, whatever was her journey up, had but an uneasy
journey of it down.——In a word, as she complained to my
uncle <i>Toby</i>, he would have tired out the patience of any flesh
alive.</p>
<h4><a id="bookI_chapXVII" name="bookI_chapXVII">
CHAPTER XVII</a></h4>
<p><span class="firstword">Though</span> my father travelled
homewards, as I told you, in none of the best of moods,—pshawing
and pishing all the way down,—yet he had the complaisance to keep
the worst part of the story still to himself;—which was the
resolution he had taken of doing himself the justice, which my uncle
<i>Toby’s</i> clause in the marriage-settlement empowered him; nor was
it till the very night in which I was begot, which was thirteen months
after, that she had the least intimation of his design: when my father,
happening, as you remember, to be a little chagrin’d and out of
temper,——took occasion as they lay chatting gravely in bed
afterwards, talking over what was to come,——to let her know
that she must accommodate herself as well as she could to the bargain
made between them in their marriage-deeds;
which was to lye-in of her next child in the country, to balance the
last year’s journey.</p>
<p>My father was a gentleman of many virtues,—but he had a strong
spice of that in his temper, which might, or might not, add to the
number.—’Tis known by the name of perseverance in a good
cause,—and of obstinacy in a bad one: Of this my mother had so
much knowledge, that she knew ’twas to no purpose to make any
remonstrance,—so she e’en resolved to sit down quietly, and make
the most of it.</p>
<h4><a id="bookI_chapXVIII" name="bookI_chapXVIII">
CHAPTER XVIII</a></h4>
<p><span class="firstword">As</span> the point was that night agreed,
or rather determined, that my mother should lye-in of me in the country,
she took her measures accordingly; for which purpose, when she was three
days, or thereabouts, gone with child, she began to cast her eyes upon
the midwife, whom you have so often heard me mention; and before the
week was well got round, as the famous Dr. <i>Manningham</i> was not to
be had, she had come to a final determination in her
mind,——notwithstanding there was a scientific operator
within so near a call as eight miles of us, and who, moreover, had
expressly wrote a five shillings book upon the subject of midwifery, in
which he had exposed, not only the blunders of the sisterhood
itself,——but had likewise superadded many curious
improvements for the quicker extraction of the fœtus in cross births,
and some other cases of danger, which belay us in getting into the
world; notwithstanding all this, my mother, I say, was absolutely
determined to trust her life, and mine with it, into no soul’s hand but
this old woman’s only.—Now this I like;—when we cannot get
at the very thing we wish——never to take up with the next
best in degree to it:—no; that’s pitiful beyond
description;—it is no more than a week from this very day, in
which I am now writing this book for the edification of the
world;—which is <i>March</i> 9, 1759,——that my dear,
dear <i>Jenny</i>, observing I looked a little grave, as she stood
cheapening a silk of five-and-twenty shillings a yard,—told the
mercer, she was sorry she had given him so much trouble;—and
immediately went and bought herself a yard-wide stuff of tenpence a
yard.—’Tis the duplication of one and the same greatness of soul;
only what lessened the honour of it, somewhat, in my mother’s case, was,
that she could not heroine it into so violent and hazardous an extreme,
as one in her
situation might have wished, because the old widwife had really some
little claim to be depended upon,—as much, at least, as success
could give her; having, in the course of her practice of near twenty
years in the parish, brought every mother’s son of them into the world
without any one slip or accident which could fairly be laid to her
account.</p>
<p>These facts, tho’ they had their weight, yet did not altogether
satisfy some few scruples and uneasinesses which hung upon my father’s
spirits in relation to this choice.—To say nothing of the natural
workings of humanity and justice—or of the yearnings of parental
and connubial love, all which prompted him to leave as little to hazard
as possible in a case of this kind;——he felt himself
concerned in a particular manner, that all should go right in the
present case;—from the accumulated sorrow he lay open to, should
any evil betide his wife and child in lying-in at
<i>Shandy-Hall</i>.——He knew the world judged by events, and
would add to his afflictions in such a misfortune, by loading him with
the whole blame of it.——“Alas, o’day;—had Mrs.
<i>Shandy</i>, poor gentlewoman! had but her wish in going up to town
just to lye-in and come down again;—which, they say, she begged
and prayed for upon her bare knees,——and which, in my
opinion, considering the fortune which Mr. <i>Shandy</i> got with
her,—was no such mighty matter to have complied with, the lady and
her babe might both of them have been alive at this hour.”</p>
<p>This exclamation, my father knew, was unanswerable;—and yet, it
was not merely to shelter himself,—nor was it altogether for the
care of his offspring and wife that he seemed so extremely anxious about
this point;—my father had extensive views of
things,——and stood moreover, as he thought, deeply concerned
in it for the publick good, from the dread he entertained of the bad
uses an ill-fated instance might be put to.</p>
<p>He was very sensible that all political writers upon the subject had
unanimously agreed and lamented, from the beginning of Queen
<i>Elizabeth’s</i> reign down to his own time, that the current of men
and money towards the metropolis, upon one frivolous errand or
another,—set in so strong,—as to become dangerous to our
civil rights,—though, by the
bye,——a <i>current</i> was not the image he took most
delight in,—a <i>distemper</i> was here his favourite
metaphor, and he would run it down into a perfect allegory, by
maintaining it was identically the same in the body national as in the
body natural where the blood and spirits were driven up into the head
faster than they could find their ways
down;——a stoppage of circulation must ensue, which was death
in both cases.</p>
<p>There was little danger, he would say, of losing our liberties by
<i>French</i> politicks or <i>French</i> invasions;——nor was
he so much in pain of a consumption from the mass of corrupted matter
and ulcerated humours in our constitution, which he hoped was not so bad
as it was imagined;—but he verily feared, that in some violent
push, we should go off, all at once, in a state-apoplexy;—and then
he would say, <i>The Lord have mercy upon us all</i>.</p>
<p>My father was never able to give the history of this
distemper,—without the remedy along with it.</p>
<p>“Was I an absolute prince,” he would say, pulling up his breeches
with both his hands, as he rose from his arm-chair, “I would
appoint able judges, at every avenue of my metropolis, who should take
cognizance of every fool’s business who came there;—and if, upon a
fair and candid hearing, it appeared not of weight sufficient to leave
his own home, and come up, bag and baggage, with his wife and children,
farmer’s sons, &amp;c., &amp;c., at his backside, they should be all
sent back, from constable to constable, like vagrants as they were, to
the place of their legal settlements. By this means I shall take care,
that my metropolis totter’d not thro’ its own weight;—that the
head be no longer too big for the body;—that the extremes, now
wasted and pinn’d in, be restored to their due share of nourishment, and
regain with it their natural strength and beauty:—I would
effectually provide, That the meadows and corn-fields of my dominions,
should laugh and sing;—that good chear and hospitality flourish
once more;—and that such weight and influence be put thereby into
the hands of the Squirality of my kingdom, as should counterpoise what I
perceive my Nobility are now taking from them.</p>
<p>“Why are there so few palaces and gentlemen’s seats,” he would ask,
with some emotion, as he walked across the room, “throughout so many
delicious provinces in <i>France?</i> Whence is it that the few
remaining <i>Chateaus</i> amongst them are so dismantled,—so
unfurnished, and in so ruinous and desolate a
condition?——Because, Sir,” (he would say) “in that
kingdom no man has any country-interest to support;—the little
interest of any kind which any man has anywhere in it, is concentrated
in the court, and the looks of the Grand Monarch: by the sunshine of
whose countenance, or the clouds which pass across it, every
<i>French</i> man lives or dies.”</p>
<p>Another political reason which prompted my father so strongly
to guard against the least evil accident in my mother’s lying-in in the
country,——was, That any such instance would infallibly throw
a balance of power, too great already, into the weaker vessels of the
gentry, in his own, or higher stations;——which, with the
many other usurped rights which that part of the constitution was hourly
establishing,—would, in the end, prove fatal to the monarchical
system of domestick government established in the first creation of
things by God.</p>
<p>In this point he was entirely of Sir <i>Robert Filmer’s</i> opinion,
That the plans and institutions of the greatest monarchies in the
eastern parts of the world were, originally, all stolen from that
admirable pattern and prototype of this household and paternal
power;—which, for a century, he said, and more, had gradually been
degenerating away into a mix’d government;——the form of
which, however desirable in great combinations of the
species,——was very troublesome in small ones,—and
seldom produced anything, that he saw, but sorrow and confusion.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, private and publick, put together,—my
father was for having the man-midwife by all means,—my mother by
no means. My father begg’d and intreated she would for once recede from
her prerogative in this matter, and suffer him to choose for
her;—my mother, on the contrary, insisted upon her privilege in
this matter, to choose for herself,—and have no mortal’s help but
the old woman’s.—What could my father do? He was almost at his
wit’s end;——talked it over with her in all
moods;—placed his arguments in all lights;—argued the matter
with her like a christian,—like a heathen,—like a
husband,—like a father,—like a patriot,—like a
man:—My mother answered everything only like a woman; which was a
little hard upon her;—for as she could not assume and fight it out
behind such a variety of characters,—’twas no fair
match:—’twas seven to one.—What could my mother
do?——She had the advantage (otherwise she had been certainly
overpowered) of a small reinforcement of chagrin personal at the bottom,
which bore her up, and enabled her to dispute the affair with my father
with so equal an advantage,——that both sides sung <i>Te
Deum</i>. In a word, my mother was to have the old woman,—and the
operator was to have licence to drink a bottle of wine with my father
and my uncle <i>Toby Shandy</i> in the back parlour,—for which he
was to be paid five guineas.</p>
<p>I must beg leave, before I finish this chapter, to enter a caveat in
the breast of my fair reader;—and it is this,——Not to
take it absolutely for granted, from an unguarded word or two which
I have dropp’d in it,——“That I am a married man.”—I
own, the tender appellation of my dear, dear <i>Jenny</i>,—with
some other strokes of conjugal knowledge, interspersed here and there,
might, naturally enough, have misled the most candid judge in the world
into such a determination against me.—All I plead for, in this
case, Madam, is strict justice, and that you do so much of it, to me as
well as to yourself,—as not to prejudge, or receive such an
impression of me, till you have better evidence, than, I am
positive, at present can be produced against me.—Not that I can be
so vain or unreasonable, Madam, as to desire you should therefore think,
that my dear, dear <i>Jenny</i> is my kept
mistress;—no,—that would be flattering my character in the
other extreme, and giving it an air of freedom, which, perhaps, it has
no kind of right to. All I contend for, is the utter impossibility, for
some volumes, that you, or the most penetrating spirit upon earth,
should know how this matter really stands.—It is not impossible,
but that my dear, dear <i>Jenny!</i> tender as the appellation is, may
be my child.——Consider,—I was born in the year
eighteen.—Nor is there anything unnatural or extravagant in the
supposition, that my dear <i>Jenny</i> may be my
friend.—Friend!—My friend.—Surely, Madam,
a friendship between the two sexes may subsist, and be supported
without———Fy! Mr. <i>Shandy</i>:—Without
anything, Madam, but that tender and delicious sentiment, which ever
mixes in friendship, where there is a difference of sex. Let me intreat
you to study the pure and sentimental parts of the best <i>French</i>
Romances;—it will really, Madam, astonish you to see with what a
variety of chaste expressions this delicious sentiment, which I have the
honour to speak of, is dress’d out.</p>

CHAPTER XIX</a></h4>
<p><span class="firstword">I would</span> sooner undertake to explain
the hardest problem in geometry, than pretend to account for it, that a
gentleman of my father’s great good sense,——knowing, as the
reader must have observed him, and curious too in philosophy,—wise
also in political reasoning,—and in polemical (as he will
find) no way ignorant,—could be capable of entertaining a notion
in his head, so out of the common track,—that I fear the reader,
when I come to mention it to him, if he is the least of a cholerick
temper, will immediately throw the book by; if mercurial, he will laugh
most heartily at it;—and if he is of a grave and saturnine cast,
he will, at first sight, absolutely condemn as fanciful and extravagant;
and that was in respect to the choice and imposition of christian names,
on which he thought a great deal more depended than what superficial
minds were capable of conceiving.</p>
<p>His opinion, in this matter, was, That there was a strange kind of
magick bias, which good or bad names, as he called them, irresistibly
impressed upon our characters and conduct.</p>
<p>The hero of <i>Cervantes</i> argued not the point with more
seriousness,——nor had he more faith,——or more to
say on the powers of necromancy in dishonouring his deeds,—or on
<span class="smallcaps">Dulcinea’s</span> name, in shedding lustre
upon them, than my father had on those of <span class="smallcaps">Trismegistus</span> or <span class="smallcaps">Archimedes</span>, on the one hand—or of <span class="smallcaps">Nyky</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Simkin</span> on
the other. How many <span class="smallcaps">Cæsars</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Pompeys</span>, he would say, by mere inspiration of
the names, have been rendered worthy of them? And how many, he would
add, are there, who might have done exceeding well in the world, had not
their characters and spirits been totally depressed and <span class="smallcaps">Nicomedus’d</span> into nothing?</p>
<p>I see plainly, Sir, by your looks (or as the case happened), my
father would say—that you do not heartily subscribe to this
opinion of mine,—which, to those, he would add, who have not
carefully sifted it to the bottom,—I own has an air more of
fancy than of solid reasoning in it;——and yet, my dear Sir,
if I may presume to know your character, I am morally assured,
I should hazard little in stating a case to you,—not as a
party in the dispute,—but as a judge, and trusting my appeal upon
it to your own good sense and candid disquisition in this
matter;——you are a person free from as many narrow
prejudices of education as most men;—and, if I may presume to
penetrate farther into you,—of a liberality of genius above
bearing down an opinion, merely because it wants friends. Your
son,—your dear son,—from whose sweet and open temper you
have so much to expect.—Your <span class="smallcaps">Billy</span>, Sir!—would you, for the world, have
called him <span class="smallcaps">Judas</span>?—Would you, my
dear Sir, he would say, laying his hand upon your breast, with the
genteelest address,—and in that soft and irresistible <i>piano</i>
of voice, which the nature of the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i>
absolutely requires,—Would you, Sir, if a <i>Jew</i> of a
godfather had proposed the name for your child, and offered you his
purse along with it, would you have consented to such a desecration of
him?——O my God! he would say, looking up, if I know your
temper right, Sir,—you are incapable of it;——you would
have trampled
upon the offer;—you would have thrown the temptation at the
tempter’s head with abhorrence.</p>
<p>Your greatness of mind in this action, which I admire, with that
generous contempt of money, which you shew me in the whole transaction,
is really noble;—and what renders it more so, is the principle of
it;—the workings of a parent’s love upon the truth and conviction
of this very hypothesis, namely, That was your son called <span class="smallcaps">Judas</span>,—the sordid and treacherous idea, so
inseparable from the name, would have accompanied him through life like
his shadow, and, in the end, made a miser and a rascal of him, in spite,
Sir, of your example.</p>
<p>I never knew a man able to answer this argument.——But,
indeed, to speak of my father as he was;—he was certainly
irresistible;—both in his orations and disputations;—he was
born an orator;—<span class="greek" title="Theodidaktos">Θεοδίδακτος</span>.—Persuasion hung upon his lips,
and the elements of Logick and Rhetorick were so blended up in
him,—and, withal, he had so shrewd a guess at the weaknesses and
passions of his respondent,——that <span class="smallcaps">Nature</span> might have stood up and said,—“This man
is eloquent.”—In short, whether he was on the weak or the strong
side of the question, ’twas hazardous in either case to attack
him.—And yet, ’tis strange, he had never read <i>Cicero</i>, nor
<i>Quintilian de Oratore</i>, nor <i>Isocrates</i>, nor
<i>Aristotle</i>, nor <i>Longinus</i> amongst the antients;—nor
<i>Vossius</i>, nor <i>Skioppius</i>, nor <i>Ramus</i>, nor
<i>Farnaby</i> amongst the moderns;—and what is more astonishing,
he had never in his whole life the least light or spark of subtilty
struck into his mind, by one single lecture upon <i>Crackenthorp</i> or
<i>Burgersdicius</i>, or any Dutch logician or commentator;—he
knew not so much as in what the difference of an argument <i>ad
ignorantiam</i>, and an argument <i>ad hominem</i> consisted; so that I
well remember, when he went up along with me to enter my name at
<i>Jesus College</i> in ****,—it was a matter of just wonder with
my worthy tutor, and two or three fellows of that learned
society,—that a man who knew not so much as the names of his
tools, should be able to work after that fashion with them.</p>
<p>To work with them in the best manner he could, was what my father
was, however, perpetually forced upon;——for he had a
thousand little sceptical notions of the comick kind to
defend——most of which notions, I verily believe, at
first entered upon the footing of mere whims, and of a <i>vive la
Bagatelle</i>; and as such he would make merry with them for half an
hour or so, and having sharpened his wit upon them, dismiss them till
another day.</p>
<p>I mention this, not only as matter of hypothesis or conjecture upon
the progress and establishment of my father’s many odd
opinions,—but as a warning to the learned reader against the
indiscreet reception of such guests, who, after a free and undisturbed
entrance, for some years, into our brains,—at length claim a kind
of settlement there,——working sometimes like
yeast;—but more generally after the manner of the gentle passion,
beginning in jest,—but ending in downright earnest.</p>
<p>Whether this was the case of the singularity of my father’s
notions—or that his judgment, at length, became the dupe of his
wit;—or how far, in many of his notions, he might, though odd, be
absolutely right;——the reader, as he comes at them, shall
decide. All that I maintain here, is, that in this one, of the influence
of christian names, however it gained footing, he was serious;—he
was all uniformity;—he was systematical, and, like all systematick
reasoners, he would move both heaven and earth, and twist and torture
everything in nature, to support his hypothesis. In a word,
I repeat it over again;—he was serious;—and, in
consequence of it, he would lose all kind of patience whenever he saw
people, especially of condition, who should have known
better,——as careless and as indifferent about the name they
imposed upon their child,—or more so, than in the choice of
<i>Ponto</i> or <i>Cupid</i> for their puppy-dog.</p>
<p>This, he would say, look’d ill;—and had, moreover, this
particular aggravation in it, viz., That when once a vile name was
wrongfully or injudiciously given, ’twas not like the case of a man’s
character, which, when wrong’d, might hereafter be
cleared;——and, possibly, some time or other, if not in the
man’s life, at least after his death,—be, somehow or other, set to
rights with the world: But the injury of this, he would say, could never
be undone;—nay, he doubted even whether an act of parliament could
reach it:——He knew as well as you, that the legislature
assumed a power over surnames;—but for very strong reasons, which
he could give, it had never yet adventured, he would say, to go a step
farther.</p>
<p>It was observable, that tho’ my father, in consequence of this
opinion, had, as I have told you, the strongest likings and dislikings
towards certain names;—that there were still numbers of names
which hung so equally in the balance before him, that they were
absolutely indifferent to him. <i>Jack</i>, <i>Dick</i>, and <i>Tom</i>
were of this class: These my father called neutral
names;—affirming of them, without a satire, That there had been as
many knaves and fools, at least, as wise and good men, since the
world began, who had indifferently borne them;—so that, like equal
forces acting against each other in contrary directions, he thought they
mutually destroyed each other’s effects; for which reason, he would
often declare, He would not give a cherry-stone to choose amongst them.
<i>Bob</i>, which was my brother’s name, was another of these neutral
kinds of christian names, which operated very little either way; and as
my father happen’d to be at <i>Epsom</i>, when it was given
him,—he would oft-times thank Heaven it was no worse.
<i>Andrew</i> was something like a negative quantity in Algebra with
him;—’twas worse, he said, than nothing.—<i>William</i>
stood pretty high:——<i>Numps</i> again was low with
him:—and <i>Nick</i>, he said, was the <span class="smallcaps">Devil</span>.</p>
<p>But, of all the names in the universe, he had the most unconquerable
aversion for <span class="smallcaps">Tristram</span>;—he had the
lowest and most contemptible opinion of it of anything in the
world,—thinking it could possibly produce nothing in <i>rerum
naturâ</i>, but what was extremely mean and pitiful: So that in the
midst of a dispute on the subject, in which, by the bye, he was
frequently involved,——he would sometimes break off in a
sudden and spirited <span class="smallcaps">Epiphonema</span>, or
rather <span class="smallcaps">Erotesis</span>, raised a third, and
sometimes a full fifth above the key of the discourse,——and
demand it categorically of his antagonist, Whether he would take upon
him to say, he had ever remembered,——whether he had ever
read,—or even whether he had ever heard tell of a man, called
<i>Tristram</i>, performing anything great or worth
recording?—No,—he would say,—<span class="smallcaps">Tristram!</span>—The thing is impossible.</p>
<p>What could be wanting in my father but to have wrote a book to
publish this notion of his to the world? Little boots it to the subtle
speculatist to stand single in his opinions,—unless he gives them
proper vent:—It was the identical thing which my father
did:—for in the year sixteen, which was two years before I was
born, he was at the pains of writing an express <span class="smallcaps">Dissertation</span> simply upon the word
<i>Tristram</i>,—shewing the world, with great candour and
modesty, the grounds of his great abhorrence to the name.</p>
<p>When this story is compared with the title-page,—Will not the
gentle reader pity my father from his soul?—to see an orderly and
well-disposed gentleman, who tho’ singular,—yet inoffensive in his
notions,—so played upon in them by cross purposes;——to
look down upon the stage, and see him baffled and overthrown in all his
little systems and wishes; to behold a train of events
perpetually falling out against him, and in so critical and cruel a way,
as if they had purposedly been plann’d and pointed against him, merely
to insult his speculations.——In a word, to behold such a
one, in his old age, ill-fitted for troubles, ten times in a day
suffering sorrow;—ten times in a day calling the child of his
prayers <span class="smallcaps">Tristram!</span>—Melancholy
dissyllable of sound! which, to his ears, was unison to
<i>Nincompoop</i>, and every name vituperative under
heaven.——By his ashes! I swear it,—if ever
malignant spirit took pleasure, or busied itself in traversing the
purposes of mortal man,—it must have been here;—and if it
was not necessary I should be born before I was christened, I would
this moment give the reader an account of it.</p>

CHAPTER XX</a></h4>
<p>———<span class="firstword">How</span> could you,
Madam, be so inattentive in reading the last chapter? I told you in
it, <i>That my mother was not a papist</i>.——Papist! You
told me no such thing, Sir.—Madam, I beg leave to repeat it
over again, that I told you as plain, at least, as words, by direct
inference, could tell you such a thing.—Then, Sir, I must
have miss’d a page.—No, Madam,—you have not miss’d a
word.——Then I was asleep, Sir.—My pride, Madam, cannot
allow you that refuge.——Then, I declare, I know
nothing at all about the matter.—That, Madam, is the very fault I
lay to your charge; and as a punishment for it, I do insist upon
it, that you immediately turn back, that is, as soon as you get to the
next full stop, and read the whole chapter over again. I have
imposed this penance upon the lady, neither out of wantonness nor
cruelty; but from the best of motives; and therefore shall make her no
apology for it when she returns back:—’Tis to rebuke a vicious
taste, which has crept into thousands besides herself,—of reading
straight forwards, more in quest of the adventures, than of the deep
erudition and knowledge which a book of this cast, if read over as it
should be, would infallibly impart with them——The mind
should be accustomed to make wise reflections, and draw curious
conclusions as it goes along; the habitude of which made <i>Pliny</i>
the younger affirm, “That he never read a book so bad, but he drew some
profit from it.” The stories of <i>Greece</i> and <i>Rome</i>, run over
without this turn and application,—do less service, I affirm
it, than the history of <i>Parismus</i> and <i>Parismenus</i>, or of the
Seven Champions of <i>England</i>, read with it.</p>
<p>———But here comes my fair lady. Have you read over
again the chapter, Madam, as I desired you?—You have: And did you
not observe the passage, upon the second reading, which admits the
inference?——Not a word like it! Then, Madam, be pleased to
ponder well the last line but one of the chapter, where I take upon me
to say, “It was <i>necessary</i> I should be born before I was
christen’d.” Had my mother, Madam, been a Papist, that consequence did
not follow.<a class="tag" href="#note_1_1" id="tag_1_1" name="tag_1_1">1</a></p>
<p>It is a terrible misfortune for this same book of mine, but more so
to the Republick of letters;—so that my own is quite swallowed up
in the consideration of it,—that this selfsame vile pruriency for
fresh adventures in all things, has got so strongly into our habit and
humour,—and so wholly intent are we upon satisfying the impatience
of our concupiscence that way,—that nothing but the gross and more
carnal parts of a composition will go down:—The subtle hints and
sly communications of science fly off, like spirits
upwards,——the heavy moral escapes downwards; and both the
one and the other are as much lost to the world, as if they were still
left in the bottom of the ink-horn.</p>
<p>I wish the male-reader has not pass’d by many a one, as quaint and
curious as this one, in which the female-reader has been detected.
I wish it may have its effects;—and that all good people,
both male and female, from her example, may be taught to think as well
as read.</p>

<h5><a id="bookI_reply" name="bookI_reply">REPONSE</a></h5>
<p class="ital">
Le Conseil estime, que la question proposée souffre de grandes
difficultés. Les Théologiens posent d’un côté pour principe, que le
baptême, qui est une naissance spirituelle, suppose une premiere
naissance; il faut être né dans le monde, pour renaître en <em>Jesus
Christ</em>, comme ils l’enseignent. <em>S. Thomas, 3 part,
quæst. 88, artic. II</em>, suit cette doctrine comme une verité
constante; l’on ne peut, dit ce S. Docteur, baptiser les enfans qui
sont renfermés dans le sein de leurs meres, &amp;
<em>S. Thomas</em> est fondé sur ce, que les enfans ne sont point
nés, &amp; ne peuvent être comptés parmi les autres hommes; d’où il
conclud, qu’ils ne peuvent être l’objet d’une action extérieure, pour
reçevoir par leur ministére, les sacremens nécessaires au salut:
<em>Pueri in maternis uteris existentes nondum prodierunt in lucem ut
cum aliis hominibus vitam ducant; unde non possunt subjici actioni
humanæ, ut per eorum ministerium sacramenta recipiant ad salutem.</em>
Les rituels ordonnent dans la pratique ce que les théologiens ont établi
sur les mêmes matiéres, &amp; ils deffendent tous d’une maniére
uniforme, de baptiser les enfans qui sont renfermés dans le sein de
leurs meres, s’ils ne font paroître quelque partie de leurs corps. Le
concours des théologiens, &amp; des rituels, qui sont les régles des
diocéses, paroit former une autorité qui termine la question presente;
cependant le conseil de conscience considerant d’un côté, que le
raisonnement des théologiens est uniquement fondé sur une raison de
convenance, &amp; que la deffense des rituels suppose que l’on ne peut
baptiser immediatement les enfans ainsi renfermés dans le sein de leurs
meres, ce qui est contre la supposition presente; &amp; d’un autre côté,
considerant que les mêmes théologiens enseignent, que l’on peut risquer
les sacremens que <em>Jesus Christ</em> a établis comme des moyens
faciles, mais nécessaires pour sanctifier les hommes; &amp; d’ailleurs
estimant, que les enfans renfermés dans le sein de leurs meres,
pourroient être capables de salut, parcequ’ils sont capables de
damnation;—pour ces considerations, &amp; en egard à l’exposé,
suivant lequel on
assure avoir trouvé un moyen certain de baptiser ces enfans ainsi
renfermés, sans faire aucun tort à la mere, le Conseil estime que l’on
pourroit se servir du moyen proposé, dans la confiance qu’il a, que Dieu
n’a point laissé ces sortes d’enfans sans aucuns secours, &amp;
supposant, comme il est exposé, que le moyen dont il s’agit est propre à
leur procurer le baptême; cependant comme il s’agiroit, en autorisant la
pratique proposée, de changer une regie universellement établie, le
Conseil croit que celui qui consulte doit s’addresser à son evêque,
&amp; à qui il appartient de juger de l’utilité, &amp; du danger du
moyen proposé, &amp; comme, sous le bon plaisir de l’evêque, le Conseil
estime qu’il faudroit recourir au Pape, qui a le droit d’expliquer les
régles de l’eglise, &amp; d’y déroger dans le cas, ou la loi ne sçauroit
obliger, quelque sage &amp; quelque utile que paroisse la maniére de
baptiser dont il s’agit, le Conseil ne pourroit l’approuver sans le
concours de ces deux autorités. On conseile au moins à celui qui
consulte, de s’addresser à son evêque, &amp; de lui faire part de la
presente décision, afin que, si le prelat entre dans les raisons sur
lesquelles les docteurs soussignés s’appuyent, il puisse être autorisé
dans le cas de nécessité, ou il risqueroit trop d’attendre que la
permission fût demandée &amp; accordée d’employer le moyen qu’il propose
si avantageux au salut de l’enfant. Au reste, le Conseil, en estimant
que l’on pourroit s’en servir, croit cependant, que si les enfans dont
il s’agit, venoient au monde, contre l’esperance de ceux qui se seroient
servis du même moyen, il seroit nécessaire de les baptiser sous
condition; &amp; en cela le Conseil se conforme Ã  tous les rituels, qui
en autorisant le baptême d’un enfant qui fait paroître quelque partie de
son corps, enjoignent néantmoins, &amp; ordonnent de le baptiser sous
condition, s’il vient heureusement au monde.</p>

CHAPTER XXI</a></h4>
<p>——I wonder what’s all that noise, and running backwards
and forwards for, above stairs, quoth my father, addressing himself,
after an hour and a half’s silence, to my uncle
<i>Toby</i>,——who, you must know, was sitting on the
opposite side of the fire, smoking his social pipe all the time, in mute
contemplation of a new pair of black plush-breeches which he had got
on:—What can they be doing, brother?—quoth my
father,—we can scarce hear ourselves talk.</p>
<p>I think, replied my uncle <i>Toby</i>, taking his pipe from his
mouth, and striking the head of it two or three times upon the nail of
his left thumb, as he began his sentence,——I think,
says he:——But to enter rightly into my uncle <i>Toby’s</i>
sentiments upon this matter, you must be made to enter first a little
into his character, the outlines of which I shall just give you, and
then the dialogue between him and my father will go on as well
again.</p>
<p>Pray what was that man’s name,—for I write in such a hurry,
I have no time to recollect or look for it,——who first
made the observation, “That there was great inconstancy in our air and
climate?” Whoever he was, ’twas a just and good observation in
him.—But the corollary drawn from it, namely, “That it is this
which has furnished us with such a variety of odd and whimsical
characters;”—that was not his;—it was found out by another
man, at least a century and a half after him: Then again,—that
this copious store-house of original materials, is the true and natural
cause that our Comedies are so much better than those of <i>France</i>,
or any others that either have, or can be wrote upon the
Continent:——that discovery was not fully made till about the
middle of King <i>William’s</i> reign,—when the great
<i>Dryden</i>, in writing one of his long prefaces, (if I mistake
not) most fortunately hit upon it. Indeed toward the latter end of Queen
<i>Anne</i>, the great <i>Addison</i> began to patronize the notion, and
more fully explained it to the world in one or two of his
Spectators;—but the discovery was not his.—Then, fourthly
and lastly, that this strange irregularity in our climate, producing so
strange an irregularity in our characters,——doth thereby, in
some sort, make us amends, by giving us somewhat to make
us merry with when the weather will not suffer us to go out of
doors,—that observation is my own;—and was struck out by me
this very rainy day, <i>March</i> 26, 1759, and betwixt the hours of
nine and ten in the morning.</p>
<p>Thus—thus, my fellow-labourers and associates in this great
harvest of our learning, now ripening before our eyes; thus it is, by
slow steps of casual increase, that our knowledge physical,
metaphysical, physiological, polemical, nautical, mathematical,
ænigmatical, technical, biographical, romantical, chemical, and
obstetrical, with fifty other branches of it, (most of ’em ending as
these do, in <i>ical</i>) have for these two last centuries and more,
gradually been creeping upwards towards that <span class="greek" title="Akmê">Ἀκμὴ</span> of their perfections, from which, if we may form a
conjecture from the advances of these last seven years, we cannot
possibly be far off.</p>
<p>When that happens, it is to be hoped, it will put an end to all kind
of writings whatsoever;—the want of all kind of writing will put
an end to all kind of reading;—and that in time, <i>As war begets
poverty; poverty peace</i>,——must, in course, put an end to
all kind of knowledge,—and then——we shall have all to
begin over again; or, in other words, be exactly where we started.</p>
<p>———Happy! thrice happy times! I only wish that the
æra of my begetting, as well as the mode and manner of it, had been a
little alter’d,——or that it could have been put off, with
any convenience to my father or mother, for some twenty or
five-and-twenty years longer, when a man in the literary world might
have stood some <span class="locked">chance.——</span></p>
<p>But I forget my uncle <i>Toby</i>, whom all this while we have left
knocking the ashes out of his tobacco-pipe.</p>
<p>His humour was of that particular species, which does honour to our
atmosphere; and I should have made no scruple of ranking him amongst one
of the first-rate productions of it, had not there appeared too many
strong lines in it of a family-likeness, which shewed that he derived
the singularity of his temper more from blood, than either wind or
water, or any modifications or combinations of them whatever: And I
have, therefore, oft-times wondered, that my father, tho’ I believe
he had his reasons for it, upon his observing some tokens of
eccentricity, in my course, when I was a boy,—should never once
endeavour to account for them in this way: for all the <span class="smallcaps">Shandy Family</span> were of an original character
throughout:——I mean the males,—the females had no
character at all,—except, indeed, my great aunt <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span>, who, about sixty years ago, was married and
got with child by the coachman, for which my father, according to
his hypothesis of christian names, would often say, She might thank her
godfathers and godmothers.</p>
<p>It will seem very strange,——and I would as soon think of
dropping a riddle in the reader’s way, which is not my interest to do,
as set him upon guessing how it could come to pass, that an event of
this kind, so many years after it had happened, should be reserved for
the interruption of the peace and unity, which otherwise so cordially
subsisted, between my father and my uncle <i>Toby</i>. One would have
thought, that the whole force of the misfortune should have spent and
wasted itself in the family at first,—as is generally the
case.—But nothing ever wrought with our family after the ordinary
way. Possibly at the very time this happened, it might have something
else to afflict it; and as afflictions are sent down for our good, and
that as this had never done the <span class="smallcaps">Shandy
Family</span> any good at all, it might lie waiting till apt times and
circumstances should give it an opportunity to discharge its
office.——Observe, I determine nothing upon
this.——My way is ever to point out to the curious, different
tracts of investigation, to come at the first springs of the events I
tell;—not with a pedantic <i>Fescue</i>,—or in the decisive
manner of <i>Tacitus</i>, who outwits himself and his reader;—but
with the officious humility of a heart devoted to the assistance merely
of the inquisitive;—to them I write,——and by them I
shall be read,——if any such reading as this could be
supposed to hold out so long,—to the very end of the world.</p>
<p>Why this cause of sorrow, therefore, was thus reserved for my father
and uncle, is undetermined by me. But how and in what direction it
exerted itself so as to become the cause of dissatisfaction between
them, after it began to operate, is what I am able to explain with great
exactness, and is as follows:</p>
<p>My uncle <span class="smallcaps">Toby Shandy</span>, Madam, was a
gentleman, who, with the virtues which usually constitute the character
of a man of honour and rectitude,——possessed one in a very
eminent degree, which is seldom or never put into the catalogue; and
that was a most extreme and unparallel’d modesty of
nature;——though I correct the word nature, for this reason,
that I may not prejudge a point which must shortly come to a hearing,
and that is, Whether this modesty of his was natural or
acquir’d.——Whichever way my uncle <i>Toby</i> came by it,
’twas nevertheless modesty in the truest sense of it; and that is,
Madam, not in regard to words, for he was so unhappy as to have very
little choice in them,—but to things;——and this kind
of modesty so possessed him, and it arose to such a height in him, as
almost
to equal, if such a thing could be, even the modesty of a woman: That
female nicety, Madam, and inward cleanliness of mind and fancy, in your
sex, which makes you so much the awe of ours.</p>
<p>You will imagine, Madam, that my uncle <i>Toby</i> had contracted all
this from this very source;—that he had spent a great part of his
time in converse with your sex; and that from a thorough knowledge of
you, and the force of imitation which such fair examples render
irresistible, he had acquired this amiable turn <ins class="correction" title="text has ‘or’">of</ins> mind.</p>
<p>I wish I could say so,—for unless it was with his
sister-in-law, my father’s wife and my mother——my uncle
<i>Toby</i> scarce exchanged three words with the sex in as many
years;—no, he got it, Madam, by a
blow.——A blow!—Yes, Madam, it was owing to a blow
from a stone, broke off by a ball from the parapet of a horn-work at the
siege of <i>Namur</i>, which struck full upon my uncle <i>Toby’s</i>
groin.—Which way could that effect it? The story of that, Madam,
is long and interesting;—but it would be running my history all
upon heaps to give it you here.——’Tis for an episode
hereafter; and every circumstance relating to it, in its proper place,
shall be faithfully laid before you:—’Till then, it is not in my
power to give farther light into this matter, or say more than what I
have said already,——That my uncle <i>Toby</i> was a
gentleman of unparallel’d modesty, which happening to be somewhat
subtilized and rarified by the constant heat of a little family
pride,——they both so wrought together within him, that he
could never bear to hear the affair of my aunt <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> touch’d upon, but with the greatest
emotion.——The least hint of it was enough to make the blood
fly into his face;—but when my father enlarged upon the story in
mixed companies, which the illustration of his hypothesis frequently
obliged him to do,—the unfortunate blight of one of the fairest
branches of the family, would set my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> honour and
modesty o’bleeding; and he would often take my father aside, in the
greatest concern imaginable, to expostulate and tell him, he would give
him anything in the world, only to let the story rest.</p>
<p>My father, I believe, had the truest love and tenderness for my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, that ever one brother bore towards another, and would have
done any thing in nature, which one brother in reason could have desir’d
of another, to have made my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> heart easy in this, or
any other point. But this lay out of his power.</p>
<p>——My father, as I told you, was a philosopher in
grain,—speculative,—systematical;—and my aunt
<i>Dinah’s</i> affair was a
matter of as much consequence to him, as the retrogradation of the
planets to <i>Copernicus</i>:—The backslidings of <i>Venus</i> in
her orbit fortified the <i>Copernican</i> system, called so after his
name; and the backslidings of my aunt <i>Dinah</i> in her orbit, did the
same service in establishing my father’s system, which, I trust,
will for ever hereafter be called the <i>Shandean System</i>, after
this.</p>
<p>In any other family dishonour, my father, I believe, had as nice a
sense of shame as any man whatever;——and neither he, nor,
I dare say, <i>Copernicus</i>, would have divulged the affair in
either case, or have taken the least notice of it to the world, but for
the obligations they owed, as they thought, to truth.—<i>Amicus
Plato</i>, my father would say, construing the words to my uncle
<i>Toby</i>, as he went along, <i>Amicus Plato</i>; that is, <span class="smallcaps">Dinah</span> was my aunt;—<i>sed magis amica
veritas</i>——but <span class="smallcaps">Truth</span> is
my sister.</p>
<p>This contrariety of humours betwixt my father and my uncle, was the
source of many a fraternal squabble. The one could not bear to hear the
tale of family disgrace recorded,——and the other would
scarce ever let a day pass to an end without some hint at it.</p>
<p>For God’s sake, my uncle <i>Toby</i> would cry,——and for
my sake, and for all our sakes, my dear brother <i>Shandy</i>,—do
let this story of our aunt’s and her ashes sleep in
peace;——how can you,——how can you have so little
feeling and compassion for the character of our
family?——What is the character of a family to an hypothesis?
my father would reply.——Nay, if you come to that—what
is the life of a family?——The life of a family!—my
uncle <i>Toby</i> would say, throwing himself back in his arm chair, and
lifting up his hands, his eyes, and one leg.——Yes, the
life,——my father would say, maintaining his point. How many
thousands of ’em are there every year that come cast away, (in all
civilized countries at least)——and considered as nothing but
common air, in competition of an hypothesis. In my plain sense of
things, my uncle <i>Toby</i> would answer,——every such
instance is downright <span class="smallcaps">Murder</span>, let who
will commit it.——There lies your mistake, my father would
reply;——for, in <i>Foro Scientiæ</i> there is no such thing
as <span class="smallcaps">Murder</span>,——’tis only <span class="smallcaps">Death</span>, brother.</p>
<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i> would never offer to answer this by any other
kind of argument, than that of whistling half a dozen bars of
<i>Lillabullero</i>.——You must know it was the usual channel
thro’ which his passions got vent, when any thing shocked or surprized
him:——but especially when any thing, which he deem’d very
absurd, was offered.</p>
<p>As not one of our logical writers, nor any of the commentators upon
them, that I remember, have thought proper to give a name to this
particular species of argument,—I here take the liberty to do
it myself, for two reasons. First, That, in order to prevent all
confusion in disputes, it may stand as much distinguished for ever, from
every other species of argument———as the <i>Argumentum
ad Verecundiam</i>, <i>ex Absurdo, ex Fortiori</i>, or any other
argument whatsoever:——And, secondly, That it may be said by
my children’s children, when my head is laid to rest,——that
their learn’d grandfather’s head had been busied to as much purpose
once, as other people’s;—That he had invented a name,—and
generously thrown it into the <span class="smallcaps">Treasury</span>
of the <i>Ars Logica</i>, for one of the most unanswerable arguments in
the whole science. And, if the end of disputation is more to silence
than convince,—they may add, if they please, to one of the best
arguments too.</p>
<p>I do therefore, by these presents, strictly order and command, That
it be known and distinguished by the name and title of the <i>Argumentum
Fistulatorium</i>, and no other;—and that it rank hereafter with
the <i>Argumentum Baculinum</i> and the <i>Argumentum ad Crumenam</i>,
and for ever hereafter be treated of in the same chapter.</p>
<p>As for the <i>Argumentum Tripodium</i>, which is never used but by
the woman against the man;—and the <i>Argumentum ad Rem</i>,
which, contrarywise, is made use of by the man only against the
woman;—As these two are enough in conscience for one
lecture;——and, moreover, as the one is the best answer to
the other,—let them likewise be kept apart, and be treated of in a
place by themselves.</p>
<h4><a id="bookI_chapXXII" name="bookI_chapXXII">
CHAPTER XXII</a></h4>
<p><span class="firstword">The</span> learned Bishop <i>Hall</i>, I
mean the famous Dr. <i>Joseph Hall</i>, who was Bishop of <i>Exeter</i>
in King <i>James</i> the First’s reign, tells us in one of his
<i>Decads</i>, at the end of his divine art of meditation, imprinted at
<i>London</i>, in the year 1610, by <i>John Beal</i>, dwelling in
<i>Aldersgate-street</i>, “That it is an abominable thing for a man to
commend himself;”——and I really think it is so.</p>
<p>And yet, on the other hand, when a thing is executed in a masterly
kind of a fashion, which thing is not likely to be found
out;—I think it is full as abominable, that a man should lose
the honour of it, and go out of the world with the conceit of it rotting
in his head.</p>
<p>This is precisely my situation.</p>
<p>For in this long digression which I was accidentally led into, as in
all my digressions (one only excepted) there is a masterstroke of
digressive skill, the merit of which has all along, I fear, been
overlooked by my reader,—not for want of penetration in
him,—but because ’tis an excellence seldom looked for, or expected
indeed, in a digression;—and it is this: That tho’ my digressions
are all fair, as you observe,—and that I fly off from what I am
about, as far, and as often too, as any writer in <i>Great Britain</i>;
yet I constantly take care to order affairs so that my main business
does not stand still in my absence.</p>
<p>I was just going, for example, to have given you the great outlines
of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> most whimsical character;—when my aunt
<i>Dinah</i> and the coachman came across us, and led us a vagary some
millions of miles into the very heart of the planetary system:
Notwithstanding all this, you perceive that the drawing of my uncle
<i>Toby’s</i> character went on gently all the time;—not the great
contours of it,—that was impossible,—but some familiar
strokes and faint designations of it, were here and there touch’d on, as
we went along, so that you are much better acquainted with my uncle
<i>Toby</i> now than you was before.</p>
<p>By this contrivance the machinery of my work is of a species by
itself; two contrary motions are introduced into it, and reconciled,
which were thought to be at variance with each other. In a word, my work
is digressive, and it is progressive too,—and at the same
time.</p>
<p>This, Sir, is a very different story from that of the earth’s moving
round her axis, in her diurnal rotation, with her progress in her
elliptick orbit which brings about the year, and constitutes that
variety and vicissitude of seasons we enjoy;—though I own it
suggested the thought,—as I believe the greatest of our boasted
improvements and discoveries have come from such trifling hints.</p>
<p>Digressions, incontestably, are the sunshine;——they are
the life, the soul of reading!—take them out of this book, for
instance,—you might as well take the book along with
them;—one cold eternal winter would reign in every page of it;
restore them to the writer;—he steps forth like a
bridegroom,—bids All-hail; brings in variety, and forbids the
appetite to fail.</p>
<p>All the dexterity is in the good cookery and management of them, so
as to be not only for the advantage of the reader, but also of the
author, whose distress, in this matter, is truly pitiable: For, if he
begins a digression,—from that moment, I observe,
his whole work stands stock still;—and if he goes on with his main
work,—then there is an end of his digression.</p>
<p>——This is vile work.—For which reason, from the
beginning of this, you see, I have constructed the main work and
the adventitious parts of it with such intersections, and have so
complicated and involved the digressive and progressive movements, one
wheel within another, that the whole machine, in general, has been kept
a-going;—and, what’s more, it shall be kept a-going these forty
years, if it pleases the fountain of health to bless me so long with
life and good spirits.</p>
<h4><a id="bookI_chapXXIII" name="bookI_chapXXIII">
CHAPTER XXIII</a></h4>
<p><span class="firstword">I have</span> a strong propensity in me to
begin this chapter very nonsensically, and I will not baulk my
fancy.—Accordingly I set off thus:</p>
<p>If the fixture of <i>Momus’s</i> glass in the human breast, according
to the proposed emendation of that arch-critick, had taken
place,——first, This foolish consequence would certainly have
followed,—That the very wisest and very gravest of us all, in one
coin or other, must have paid window-money every day of our lives.</p>
<p>And, secondly, That had the said glass been there set up, nothing
more would have been wanting, in order to have taken a man’s character,
but to have taken a chair and gone softly, as you would to a dioptrical
beehive, and look’d in,—view’d the soul stark
naked;—observed all her motions,—her
machinations;—traced all her maggots from their first engendering
to their crawling forth;—watched her loose in her frisks, her
gambols, her capricios; and after some notice of her more solemn
deportment, consequent upon such frisks, etc.——then taken
your pen and ink and set down nothing but what you had seen, and could
have sworn to:—But this is an advantage not to be had by the
biographer in this planet;—in the planet <i>Mercury</i> (belike)
it may be so, if not better still for him;——for there the
intense heat of the country, which is proved by computators, from its
vicinity to the sun, to be more than equal to that of red-hot
iron,—must, I think, long ago have vitrified the bodies of
the inhabitants, (as the efficient cause) to suit them for the
climate (which is the final cause); so that betwixt them both, all the
tenements of their souls, from top to bottom, may be nothing else, for
aught the soundest philosophy can shew to the contrary, but one fine
transparent body of clear glass (bating the umbilical
knot)—so that, till the inhabitants grow old and tolerably
wrinkled, whereby the rays of light, in passing through them, become so
monstrously refracted,——or return reflected from their
surfaces in such transverse lines to the eye, that a man cannot be seen
through;—his soul might as well, unless for mere ceremony, or the
trifling advantage which the umbilical point gave her,—might, upon
all other accounts, I say, as well play the fool out o’doors as in
her own house.</p>
<p>But this, as I said above, is not the case of the inhabitants of this
earth;—our minds shine not through the body, but are wrapt up here
in a dark covering of uncrystalized flesh and blood; so that, if we
would come to the specific characters of them, we must go some other way
to work.</p>
<p>Many, in good truth, are the ways, which human wit has been forced to
take, to do this thing with exactness.</p>
<p>Some, for instance, draw all their characters with
wind-instruments.—<i>Virgil</i> takes notice of that way in the
affair of <i>Dido</i> and <i>Æneas</i>;—but it is as fallacious as
the breath of fame;—and, moreover, bespeaks a narrow genius.
I am not ignorant that the <i>Italians</i> pretend to a
mathematical exactness in their designations of one particular sort of
character among them, from the <i>forte</i> or <i>piano</i> of a certain
wind-instrument they use,—which they say is
infallible.—I dare not mention the name of the instrument in
this place;—’tis sufficient we have it amongst us,—but never
think of making a drawing by it;—this is ænigmatical, and intended
to be so, at least <i>ad populum</i>:—And therefore, I beg,
Madam, when you come here, that you read on as fast as you can, and
never stop to make any inquiry about it.</p>
<p>There are others again, who will draw a man’s character from no other
helps in the world, but merely from his evacuations;—but this
often gives a very incorrect outline,—unless, indeed, you take a
sketch of his repletions too; and by correcting one drawing from the
other, compound one good figure out of them both.</p>
<p>I should have no objection to this method, but that I think it must
smell too strong of the lamp,—and be render’d still more operose,
by forcing you to have an eye to the rest of his
<i>Non-naturals</i>.——Why the most natural actions of a
man’s life should be called his Non-naturals,—is another
question.</p>
<p>There are others, fourthly, who disdain every one of these
expedients;—not from any fertility of their own, but from the
various ways of doing it, which they have borrowed from the
honourable devices which the Pentagraphic Brethren<a class="tag" href="#note_1_3" id="tag_1_3" name="tag_1_3">3</a> of the brush have
shewn in taking copies.—These, you must know, are your great
historians.</p>
<p>One of these you will see drawing a full-length character <i>against
the light</i>;—that’s illiberal,—dishonest,—and hard
upon the character of the man who sits.</p>
<p>Others, to mend the matter, will make a drawing of you in the
<i>Camera</i>;—that is most unfair of all,—because,
<i>there</i> you are sure to be represented in some of your most
ridiculous attitudes.</p>
<p>To avoid all and every one of these errors in giving you my uncle
<i>Toby’s</i> character, I am determined to draw it by no
mechanical help whatever;——nor shall my pencil be guided by
any one wind-instrument which ever was blown upon, either on this, or on
the other side of the <i>Alps</i>;—nor will I consider either his
repletions or his discharges,—or touch upon his
Non-naturals—but, in a word, I will draw my uncle
<i>Toby’s</i> character from his <span class="smallcaps">Hobby-Horse</span>.</p>
<h4><a id="bookI_chapXXIV" name="bookI_chapXXIV">
CHAPTER XXIV</a></h4>
<p><span class="firstword">If</span> I was not morally sure that the
reader must be out of all patience for my uncle <i>Toby’s</i>
character,——I would here previously have convinced him
that there is no instrument so fit to draw such a thing with, as that
which I have pitch’d upon.</p>
<p>A man and his <span class="smallcaps">Hobby-Horse</span>, tho’ I
cannot say that they act and re-act exactly after the same manner in
which the soul and body do upon each other: Yet doubtless there is a
communication between them of some kind; and my opinion rather is, that
there is something in it more of the manner of electrified
bodies,—and that, by means of the heated parts of the rider, which
come immediately into contact with the back of the <span class="smallcaps">Hobby-Horse</span>,—by long journeys and much
friction, it so happens, that the body of the rider is at length fill’d
as full of <span class="smallcaps">Hobby-Horsical</span> matter as it
can hold;——so that if you are able to give but a clear
description of the nature of the one, you may form a pretty exact notion
of the genius and character of the other.</p>
<p>Now the <span class="smallcaps">Hobby-Horse</span> which my uncle
<i>Toby</i> always rode upon, was in my opinion a <span class="smallcaps">Hobby-Horse</span> well worth giving a description of, if it
was only upon the score of his great singularity;—for
you might have travelled from <i>York</i> to <i>Dover</i>,—from
<i>Dover</i> to <i>Penzance</i> in <i>Cornwall</i>, and from
<i>Penzance</i> to <i>York</i> back again, and not have seen such
another upon the road; or if you had seen such a one, whatever haste you
had been in, you must infallibly have stopp’d to have taken a view of
him. Indeed, the gait and figure of him was so strange, and so utterly
unlike was he, from his head to his tail, to any one of the whole
species, that it was now and then made a matter of
dispute,——whether he was really a <span class="smallcaps">Hobby-Horse</span> or no: but as the Philosopher would use
no other argument to the Sceptic, who disputed with him against the
reality of motion, save that of rising up upon his legs, and walking
across the room;—so would my uncle <i>Toby</i> use no other
argument to prove his <span class="smallcaps">Hobby-Horse</span> was a
<span class="smallcaps">Hobby-Horse</span> indeed, but by getting upon
his back and riding him about;—leaving the world, after that, to
determine the point as it thought fit.</p>
<p>In good truth, my uncle <i>Toby</i> mounted him with so much
pleasure, and he carried my uncle <i>Toby</i> so well,——that
he troubled his head very little with what the world either said or
thought about it.</p>
<p>It is now high time, however, that I give you a description of
him:—But to go on regularly, I only beg you will give me
leave to acquaint you first, how my uncle <i>Toby</i> came by him.</p>
<h4><a id="bookI_chapXXV" name="bookI_chapXXV">
CHAPTER XXV</a></h4>
<p><span class="firstword">The</span> wound in my uncle <i>Toby’s</i>
groin, which he received at the siege of <i>Namur</i>, rendering him
unfit for the service, it was thought expedient he should return to
<i>England</i>, in order, if possible, to be set to rights.</p>
<p>He was four years totally confined,—part of it to his bed, and
all of it to his room: and in the course of his cure, which was all that
time in hand, suffer’d unspeakable miseries,—owing to a succession
of exfoliations from the <i>os pubis</i>, and the outward edge of that
part of the <i>coxendix</i> called the <i>os
illium</i>,——both which bones were dismally crush’d, as much
by the irregularity of the stone, which I told you was broke off the
parapet,—as by its size,—(tho’ it was pretty large) which
inclined the surgeon all along to think, that the great injury which it
had done my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> groin, was more owing to the gravity of
the stone itself, than to the projectile force of it,—which he
would often tell him was a great happiness.</p>
<p>My father at that time was just beginning business in <i>London</i>,
and had taken a house;—and as the truest friendship and cordiality
subsisted between the two brothers,—and that my father thought my
uncle <i>Toby</i> could no where be so well nursed and taken care of as
in his own house,——he assign’d him the very best apartment
in it.—And what was a much more sincere mark of his affection
still, he would never suffer a friend or an acquaintance to step into
the house on any occasion, but he would take him by the hand, and lead
him up stairs to see his brother <i>Toby</i>, and chat an hour by his
bedside.</p>
<p>The history of a soldier’s wound beguiles the pain of it;—my
uncle’s visitors at least thought so, and in their daily calls upon him,
from the courtesy arising out of that belief, they would frequently turn
the discourse to that subject,—and from that subject the discourse
would generally roll on to the siege itself.</p>
<p>These conversations were infinitely kind; and my uncle <i>Toby</i>
received great relief from them, and would have received much more, but
that they brought him into some unforeseen perplexities, which, for
three months together, retarded his cure greatly; and if he had not hit
upon an expedient to extricate himself out of them, I verily
believe they would have laid him in his grave.</p>
<p>What these perplexities of my uncle <i>Toby</i>
were,——’tis impossible for you to guess;—if you
could,—I should blush; not as a relation,—not as a
man,—nor even as a woman,—but I should blush as an author;
inasmuch as I set no small store by myself upon this very account, that
my reader has never yet been able to guess at anything. And in this,
Sir, I am of so nice and singular a humour, that if I thought you
was able to form the least judgment or probable conjecture to yourself,
of what was to come in the next page,—I would tear it out of
my book.</p>
