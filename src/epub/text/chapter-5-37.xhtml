				<p>The description of the siege of <i>Jericho</i> itself, could not have engaged the attention of my uncle <i>Toby</i> more powerfully than the last chapter;—his eyes were fixed upon my father throughout it;—he never mentioned radical heat and radical moisture, but my uncle <i>Toby</i> took his pipe out of his mouth, and shook his head; and as soon as the chapter was finished, he beckoned to the corporal to come close to his chair, to ask him the following question,—<i>aside</i>.——<span id="aside"/><script type="text/javascript"> asterisks("aside",1.3,3); </script> <noscript><span class="space35">* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *</span></noscript> It was at the siege of <i>Limerick</i>, an’ please your honour, replied the corporal, making a bow.</p>
				<p>The poor fellow and I, quoth my uncle <i>Toby</i>, addressing himself to my father, were scarce able to crawl out of our tents, at the time the siege of <i>Limerick</i> was raised, upon the very account you mention.——Now what can have got into that precious noddle of thine, my dear brother <i>Toby?</i> cried my father, mentally.——By Heaven! continued he, communing still with himself, it would puzzle an <i>Œdipus</i> to bring it in <span class="locked">point.——</span></p>
				<p>I believe, an’ please your honour, quoth the corporal, that if it had not been for the quantity of brandy we set fire to every night, and the claret and cinnamon with which I plyed your honour off;—And the geneva, <i>Trim</i>, added my uncle <i>Toby</i>, which did us more good than all——I verily believe, continued the corporal, we had both, an’ please your honour, left our lives in the trenches, and been buried in them too.——The noblest grave, corporal! cried my uncle <i>Toby</i>, his eyes sparkling as he spoke, that a soldier could wish to lie down in.——But a pitiful death for him! an’ please your honour, replied the corporal.</p>
				<p>All this was as much <i>Arabick</i> to my father, as the rites of the <i>Colchi</i> and <i>Troglodites</i> had been before to my uncle <i>Toby</i>; my father could not determine whether he was to frown or to <span class="locked">smile.——</span></p>
				<p>My uncle <i>Toby</i>, turning to <i>Yorick</i>, resumed the case at <ins class="correction" title="printed in Roman (non-italic) type"><i>Limerick</i></ins>, more intelligibly than he had begun it,—and so settled the point for my father at once.</p>
