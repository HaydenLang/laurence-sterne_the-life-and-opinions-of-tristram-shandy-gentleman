				<h2 epub:type="title">A Dedication to a Great Man</h2>
				<p><b>My Lord</b>,</p>
				<p>Having, <i>a priori</i>, intended to dedicate <i>The Amours of my Uncle Toby</i> to Mr. ***——I see more reasons, <i>a posteriori</i>, for doing it <ins class="correction" title="text reads ‘too’">to</ins> Lord *******.</p>
				<p>I should lament from my soul, if this exposed me to the jealousy of their Reverences; because <i>a posteriori</i>, in Court-latin, signifies the kissing hands for preferment—or anything else—in order to get it.</p>
				<p>My opinion of Lord ******* is neither better nor worse, than it was of Mr. ***. Honours, like impressions upon coin, may give an ideal and local value to a bit of base metal; but Gold and Silver will pass all the world over without any other recommendation than their own weight.</p>
				<p>The same good-will that made me think of offering up half an hour’s amusement to Mr. *** when out of place—operates more forcibly at present, as half an hour’s amusement will be more serviceable and refreshing after labour and sorrow, than after a philosophical repast.</p>
				<p>Nothing is so perfectly <i>amusement</i> as a total change of ideas; no ideas are so totally different as those of Ministers, and innocent Lovers: for which reason, when I come to talk of Statesmen and Patriots, and set such marks upon them as will prevent confusion and mistakes concerning them for the future—I propose to dedicate that Volume to some gentle Shepherd,</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Whose thoughts proud Science never taught to stray,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far as the Statesman’s walk or Patriot-way;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet <i>simple Nature</i> to his hopes had given</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of a cloud-capp’d head a humbler heaven;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some <i>untam’d</i> World in depths of wood embraced—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some happier Island in the watry-waste—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And where admitted to that equal sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His <i>faithful Dog</i> should bear him company.</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>In a word, by thus introducing an entire new set of objects to his Imagination, I shall unavoidably give a <i>Diversion</i> to his passionate and love-sick Contemplations. In the meantime,</p>
