				<p><span class="firstword">Why</span> weavers, gardeners, and gladiators—or a man with a pined leg (proceeding from some ailment in the <i>foot</i>)—should ever have had some tender nymph breaking her heart in secret for them, are points well and duly settled and accounted for by ancient and modern physiologists.</p>
				<p>A water-drinker, provided he is a profess’d one, and does it without fraud or covin, is precisely in the same predicament: not that, at first sight, there is any consequence, or show of logic in it, “That a rill of cold water dribbling through my inward parts, should light up a torch in my <i>Jenny’s</i>—”</p>
				<p>——The proposition does not strike one; on the contrary, it seems to run opposite to the natural workings of causes and <span class="locked">effects——</span></p>
				<p>But it shews the weakness and imbecility of human reason.</p>
				<p>——“And in perfect good health with it?”</p>
				<p>—The most perfect,—Madam, that friendship herself could wish <span class="locked">me——</span></p>
				<p>“And drink nothing!—nothing but water?”</p>
				<p>—Impetuous fluid! the moment thou pressest against the flood-gates of the brain——see how they give <span class="locked">way!——</span></p>
				<p>In swims <span class="smallcaps">Curiosity</span>, beckoning to her damsels to follow—they dive into the centre of the <span class="locked">current——</span></p>
				<p><span class="smallcaps">Fancy</span> sits musing upon the bank, and with her eyes following the stream, turns straws and bulrushes into masts and bowsprits——And <span class="smallcaps">Desire</span>, with vest held up to the knee in one hand, snatches at them, as they swim by her with the <span class="locked">other——</span></p>
				<p>O ye water-drinkers! is it then by this delusive fountain, that ye have so often governed and turn’d this world about like a mill-wheel—grinding the faces of the impotent—bepowdering their ribs—bepeppering their noses, and changing sometimes even the very frame and face of <span class="locked">nature——</span></p>
				<p>If I was you, quoth <i>Yorick</i>, I would drink more water, <i>Eugenius</i>—And, if I was you, <i>Yorick</i>, replied <i>Eugenius</i>, so would I.</p>
				<p>Which shews they had both read <i>Longinus</i>——</p>
				<p>For my own part, I am resolved never to read any book but my own, as long as I live.</p>
