<p><span class="firstword">The</span> corporal had slipped out about
ten minutes before my uncle <i>Toby</i>, in order to fix his apparatus,
and just give the enemy a shot or two before my uncle <i>Toby</i>
came.</p>
<p>He had drawn the six field-pieces for this end, all close up
<span class="pagenum">
<a id="page334" name="page334">334</a></span>
together in front of my uncle <i>Toby’s</i> sentry-box, leaving only an
interval of about a yard and a half betwixt the three, on the right and
left, for the convenience of charging, &amp;c.—and the sake
possibly of two batteries, which he might think double the honour of
one.</p>
<p>In the rear and facing this opening, with his back to the door of the
sentry-box, for fear of being flanked, had the corporal wisely taken his
post:——He held the ivory pipe, appertaining to the battery
on the right, betwixt the finger and thumb of his right hand,—and
the ebony pipe tipp’d with silver, which appertained to the battery on
the left, betwixt the finger and thumb of the other——and
with his right knee fixed firm upon the ground, as if in the front rank
of his platoon, was the corporal with his Montero-cap upon his head,
furiously playing off his two cross batteries at the same time against
the counter-guard, which faced the counter-scarp, where the attack was
to be made that morning. His first intention, as I said, was no more
than giving the enemy a single puff or two;—but the pleasure of
the <i>puffs</i>, as well as the <i>puffing</i>, had insensibly got hold
of the corporal, and drawn him on from puff to puff, into the very
height of the attack, by the time my uncle <i>Toby</i> joined him.</p>
<p>’Twas well for my father, that my uncle <i>Toby</i> had not his will
to make that day.</p>
