				<p>As I perceived the commissary of the post-office would have his six livres four sous, I had nothing else for it, but to say some smart thing upon the occasion, worth the money:</p>
				<p>And so I set off thus:——</p>
				<p>——And pray, Mr. Commissary, by what law of courtesy is a defenceless stranger to be used just the reverse from what you use a <i>Frenchman</i> in this matter?</p>
				<p>By no means; said he.</p>
				<p>Excuse me; said I—for you have begun, Sir, with first tearing off my breeches—and now you want my <span class="locked">pocket——</span></p>
				<p>Whereas—had you first taken my pocket, as you do with your own people—and then left me bare a—’d after—I had been a beast to have <span class="locked">complain’d——</span></p>
				<p>As it is——</p>
				<p>——’Tis contrary to the <i>law of nature</i>.</p>
				<p>——’Tis contrary to <i>reason</i>.</p>
				<p>——’Tis contrary to the <span class="smallroman">GOSPEL</span>.</p>
				<p>But not to this——said he—putting a printed paper into my hand,</p>

				<p>——By all which it appears, quoth I, having read it over, a little too rapidly, that if a man sets out in a post-chaise from <i>Paris</i>—he must go on travelling in one, all the days of his life—or pay for it.—Excuse me, said the commissary, the spirit of the ordinance is this—That if you set out with an intention of running post from <i>Paris</i> to <i>Avignon</i>, &amp;c., you shall not change that intention or mode of travelling, without first satisfying the fermiers for two posts further than the place you repent at—and ’tis founded, continued he, upon this, that the <span class="smallroman">REVENUES</span> are not to fall short through your <span class="locked"><i>fickleness</i>——</span></p>
				<p>——O by heavens! cried I—if fickleness is taxable in <i>France</i>—we have nothing to do but to make the best peace with you we <span class="locked">can——</span></p>
				<p><span class="smallroman">AND SO THE PEACE WAS MADE</span>;</p>
				<p>——And if it is a bad one—as <i>Tristram Shandy</i> laid the corner-stone of it—nobody but <i>Tristram Shandy</i> ought to be hanged.</p>
